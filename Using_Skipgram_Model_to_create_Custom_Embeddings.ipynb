attend both interviews  the next stage interviews which rounds that non eliminatory  based on this online test they shortlisted candidates  both based on strings and relatively easy  round interview round in which we questions based on dsa and dynamic programming st round coding round that questions  st round resume based shortlisting  the interview largely tested my conceptual understanding and problem solving rather than specific skill  for projects know why you have adopted certain algorithm or why you have taken certain decision and have basic idea about alternative approaches  know whatever you have in your resume like the back of your hand  worked on ev battery management related projects so about their implementation and on the concepts involved  mostly based on projects on my

and do this for every element from to n  explained to him the sieve of eratosthenes approach and he satisfied  find all prime numbers between to n  find all such good triplets if x y z n n will given to you  consider triplet x y z to good if y x and z y x  shared my screen and explained him on scratch pad with the diagram and equations  explained the slow and fast pointer approach and then he me

of the triplet  you not allowed to use map and each array element in the range of  given an array find all the distinct elements in  he also me to share the screen and code  the interviewer me to list down all sorting algorithms that knew and then he told me to explain quicksort  technical interview this face to face interview round and lasted for hour  online assessment consisted of coding

steps to the interviewer  and the interviewer took the screenshot for that code  writing the code and obviously my first and thought about the logic for minutes and by god grace got proper idea of recursion and able to write the code for tic tac toe in next to mins with all edge cases  tbh not knowing how to write code for tic tac toe game in first attempt and in an interview itself to write code in c and that think is having very similar idea to the sudoku solver question very famous backtracking problem and he said to implement that idea  said am comfortable with c and can go ahead with that and after some time they said fine and go ahead  after this they me to develop tic tac toe game in javascript in vs code  how linkedlist is better than array ? all these questions very easy if you have practised proper cp dsa  after this they to dsa waiting for this moment but here also they easy questions only what is dsa definition definition of array multidimensional array linked list stack queue binary trees with example  all these questions upto interviewer and their mood so dw and just mention what you know  this question is very famous question of some ias ras interview and

microsoft visited our campus and there engage student have to give direct interview without any coding round and that is basically technical hr round this round also goes for hr in this first he grilled me lot on engage project prepared for this so answered every question related to project then he comes to technical part in this he question from trees hashmap stack queue time complexities of these and then some hr question  after qualifying this program got onboard with month of mentorship program in which to create microsoft teams clone within month at the end of this program we have to submit github repo link of our code and also demo video to show the features of our app and how works after one week of submission got mail of technical interview this interview goes around for  you must well prepared with dsa sorting searching algorithm time complexities to qualify this round i applied for the microsoft engage mentorship program in may for this follow arsh goyal on linkedin who give regular update on off campus opportunities as get to know about this program from him only so the first round consisted of mcqs writing pseudo code reasoning  after this part we still minutes of time so he me to explain more about race condition and after that some questions about adobe and why is not working on particular area iaas  after these questions he me few os theory questions mainly on deadlocks race condition  round minutes this is technical round where been questions about my project and after discussion of projects interviewer me to code binary search reversing linked list and checking whether linked list is palindrome or not  twelve members got shortlisted for round  confident and through in dsa to clear round round there few aptitude some jee level maths probability and statistics some linear algebra questions and two codes in which one is gfg medium level question and another is gfg easy level question  he satisfied with all of my answers  some questions on cs concepts like virtual pointers virtual functions cache replacement strategies  question on vertical traversal given tree find the sum of all nodes that present on the same vertical line  and then he me to consider snake and ladder both snakes and ladders find the shortest path to reach the end using dice  of ways to reach end  round technical interview question on dp given snake and ladder having only ladders no snakes no dice find no  descriptive question on our project  first we have to find all the sub sequences of the array of exactly elements and then find the maximum of minimum difference of all pairs from subsequences  determine the number of moves to make all elements equal  mcqs on linear algebra probability statistics puzzles  the last round the hr round interviewer me

technical interview min  st round an online test of min consisted of mcq type questions based on dsa and two coding questions one easy and the second the medium difficulty level  few questions and the interviewer happy to answer them  the interview lasted for around mins and towards the end the interviewer me if any questions  this interview comparatively shorter than the previous one  after that he me one input output c language question similar to what we in the c programming course quiz in st year  informed the interviewer but he decided to go on with the same question  he me question that very similar to the question in my first round  the interviewer me some standard hr questions and then moved on to dsa  round interview hr dsa this round also began with my introduction  questions in mind and the interviewer happy to answer them  the interview lasted for around mins and towards the end the interviewer me if any questions for him  he me an easy medium level question and for the most optimum solution  the interviewer told me he impressed with my first project and moved on to dsa based questions  detailed explanation of both the projects including problems we faced during the project  explained two of the three projects in my resume  they also me if faced any difficulties during my project and if yes how did overcome  round interview project dsa they me to introduce myself and then directly me to explain or of my projects  oracle shortlists many students from our batch around people shortlisted for server tech and for app dev  they focused lot on avl trees so to go through the topic once before the test  they all multiple choice questions but each section subsections with their own time limit the round divided into four sections english communication aptitude computer science theory core primarily os dbms and oops and understanding code output  mcq based minute long proctored test  round online assessment round this round different from the regular coding rounds where you get dsa based coding problems  applied for both positions and selected for interviews in server technology  you can apply for either of the two roles or you can apply for both and randomly selected for one of the two roles for interviews  on iris they appear to two separate applications but they both go through the same initial online assessment round oracle india has two positions for interns in our college server technology and application development  the interviewer good good interaction with him  few question in the end  so they me to introduce myself and then me to explain one project from resume after explanation they me size of group and my contribution in the project and me the social media which like the most and what like in that  after this round the final round hr round this round is basically the chitchat between the hr and me of connected components bfs  after this second round first me introduce myself and then coding question given based on graphs no  in the first tech round they first me to introduce myself and then explanation of the projects which wrote in my resume and then they me to do coding questions one is given the tree have to say that the given tree is symmetric about the root or not and other is given linked list remove the nth node from the last they to write the code and me to dry run that  tech and one is hr round  there rounds of interview  after the test members shortlisted initial screening test conducted in the exam coding questions given easy and other is difficult and some mcq s also given didn remember the exact number of questions on aptitude os output based questions  at pm all the selected candidates to join zoom meet and the results announced  and the interview ended with discussion on different projects and tech stacks that interns get to work on  then we moved to the hr part situational question if the manager decided to send your code for production but there some bugs still what would you do ? and few questions on my hobbies this for around mins  able to write the query  then simple sql query  then what should if an array has reached its maximum limit and can no longer resized  this question bit vague for me as not well with the concepts of interfaces in oops so just told not sure about this  then to import the above two classes to another file that has two client functions and each function should able to call the push and pop method of any of the classes  also explained implementation with deque  clean code along with proper oops concepts is expected  can use any data structure to implement so implemented using vector  to implement two classes in c which have the push and pop functions for stack  round technical hr round went for mins again with my intro  the shortlist released after an hour and students went to the next round  lastly if have any questions for him questions and the interview ended  then sql query couldn write the complete syntax correctly but explained the query  while coding stuck at some point so the interviewer helped me by giving some hints and then could complete  to optimize so binary search based solution of o logn and coded  then dsa question to present my screen and open notepad for coding given an array return the index of any of the local minimum first explained the brute force o n solution  java does not support multiple inheritance but c does which concept of oops in c is responsible for this ? here the interviewer explained to me in detail why java does not support multiple inheritance so able to answer this question easily  so better do this mistake and solving all the questions that you encounter for that particular company  but able to answer  seen this question the previous day on gfg archives for morgan stanley but didn bother to and in interview realized my mistake  to explain concepts of oops using the computer keyboard  then about the pillars of oops  round technical interview went for about an hour with my intro  after this round students shortlisted for interviews  coding easy medium questions hr could do questions completely and remaining question passed of the test cases  debugging simple questions mins very simple can easily all of them in given time  round online test aptitude mcqs mins solving most of them morgan stanley only rounds in total online test and interviews  for example they me how coped with the online mode of college  they might even you casual questions  behavioural questions also posed to you and they you about how you have handled leadership roles in the past  they you to introduce yourself then they you questions related to your resume past projects internships roles  half an hour slot  round tech hr interview  those who performed well in the gd selected for the interviews  each panel comprised of about to candidates  the topic given is high time that mental health awareness programs introduced into the educational curriculum in india  round resume shortlisting on the basis of gpa round group discussion the selection happened in total of three phases  the interview pretty decent and waste time on the questions which you do not know  puzzle question based on xor gate  detecting nonoverlapping sequence with sequence inputs  total bits resulting in multiplying bit numbers  range of signed and unsigned numbers we can define using n bits  implementing input nand gate using input nand gates the total number for nand gates required for making n input nand gate  implementing nand gate using mux  no of bits resulted by adding two bit numbers and then total extra bits required for adding bit numbers  each question built upon the previous questions  questioned mostly on combinational and sequential circuit questions  based on your performance you can shortlisted for more than one profile  shortlisted for the digital profile  round interview round  found analog questions to on the tougher side  in the case of digital questions based on counters setup and hold time analysis mux and fsm  analog questions basically consisted of rlc circuits opamps and transistors  attempted only the hardware profile consisted of analog minutes digital minutes aptitude minutes questions  aptitude being compulsory for all  online test included hardware and software profiles or both round online test resume shortlisting  general questions on carbon capture polymers round resume shortlisting round group discussion topic can ai replace human beings round technical hr interview some questions about my previous internships and interests  few weeks after the submission received direct internship offer mail from microsoft  also we told to use the agile methodology while planning and implementing our projects  at the end of the program we to provide github repo link of our code and also demo video to demonstrate how our app works  the task to create microsoft teams clone within month  the students shortlisted after this round divided into groups with mentees each and mentors who engineers working at microsoft  you must well prepared with dsa and core cs fundamentals including time complexities inner workings of data structures used in stl to qualify this round  the first round consisted of mcqs writing pseudo code reasoning i applied for the microsoft engage mentorship program in may  third round hr interview  can last anyway between mins  second round technical interview  after the psychometric assessment very few people selected for the round  self paced personality test  shortlisted candidates received another assessment invite to complete psychometric assessment  sections english logical reasoning quantitative aptitude and technical  marking scheme for correct answer first round online test min  few situations given and you to relate to your experience  some deep questions based on the domains which my project based on  round technical interview questions based on resume work experience projects  round group discussion again cgpa plays major role top gpa students placed in separate gd panel round resume shortlisting its just fancy term for cgpa shortlisting  finally four candidates offered intern online test aptitude english and coding questions basic dsa coding interview interview on resume and final hr round  to problem with oops concepts and standard hr questions on teamwork and how one should respond in some situations  round techincal hr with introduction of myself and project  out of shortlisted for the round  one data structure design question create data structure that can store unique elements and have functionalities of insert remove and accessing the random value from the data structure proposed some approaches for this but with not expected complexity org program to check if binary tree is bst or not have to explain the logic and code as well in notepad  one medium level standard coding problem check whether the given tree is bst or not https www org memory layout of c program  round techincal about hr about the pointers references their memory allocation and heap stack memory refer to this article is very much helpful https www  after the online test shortlisted for zoom interviews org counting inversions  some tweaked version of inversion count https www org length of the longest valid substring  longest valid parentheses https www org maximum time required for all patients to get infected  graph bfs question similar to this https www  consists of sections aptitude min debugging questions min and three coding questions initially there standard screening test  this followed by some standard hr questions  then in detail about the project and the mentorship program listed on my resume  there one puzzle kinda question that based on the project on my resume  wasn to code maybe due to lack of time  this one coding question for which to explain my approach  the second round technical hr interview  one of them similar to the knapsack problem  the first round an online test that two programming questions the selection procedure consisted of two rounds  candidates selected for internship  and around pm they keep meet and announce the result and congratulate us  and in last some basic hr questions like why morgan stanely  after he me situational base question like st round here also he want which data structure is good for this condition and why ? after that he asks me some os process synchronization and dbms normalization questions  then he asks me to explain the project in my resume and questions on that  round technical hr again introduction  after st round out of selected for the round  after that he me sql query which is easy  after that he asks me that which scheduling algorithms know then he me table and he told me to use these algorithms and tell me which process executes first  he nice he me hints and whenever told him an answer then we have long discussion about why we use that what is its time complexity  after that he me two situational base questions and he wants which data structure or algorithm we have to choose for that which suits better  st round technical firstly he asks to introduce myself  after that students shortlisted for interviews coding round there sections in the first section there some aptitude questions in min in the second section there simple debugging questions in min and in the last section there programming question not hard that much can say leetcode medium level which we have to do in min  as an intern what can you offer to company like visa and then he do have any question or not  in round technical round hr round interviewer me some dsa questions on two pointer algorithm and dp problem which variation of fibonacci problem then interviewer some basic questions on synchronization and my projects which simple questions the interviewer some standard hr questions some hr questions like why should we hire you ? describe downs in your life and how you tackled them  st round coding questions which where based on dp knapsack variation and heap based problem  the interviewer friendly and will give u few mins more if u  the last round hr tech general hr questions and few resume based qs  my knowledge in os and dbms tested  then given few situations or problems to check how will applying my dsa knowledge  to code question related to stacks  round purely tech interview  good grip on dsa and cp is enough to crack this round  the coding section consists of qs of easy medium hard level and has more weightage  aptitude and debugging sections aren though  aptitude debugging and coding  st round consists of sections  we ended each interview with session where could inquire about the company and its future prospects  both my interviewers me about all the courses taken up so far relevant to the profile applying for and refrained from any questions that beyond the scope of my knowledge  this interview also lasted give or take an hour  finally to design mod counter and explain the process  next we moved on to few questions on binary addition multiplication which involved bit of math where to derive general formula for the number of extra bits required when n bit numbers added together  digital interview here initially about how x mux can used to implement an or gate given some constraints  although this might seem tiring the questions will definitely keep you on your toes  my interview process lasted about hr min  tip remember the interviewer is only trying to understand the way you think given problem how you approach your ability to process any hints given quickly  although my final answer wrong due to calculation error the interviewer satisfied with my approach  also rather simple yet interesting question on op amps that solely relied on the fundamental properties of an op amp straight forward kvl kcl equations  one of the most common questions is to find the output response across circuit component given particular type of input signal may an impulse step or ramp  hint do not use those fancy mathematical equations you learned in college rather stick to your basics and to analyze the circuit intuitively from scratch without any premeditations  although might seem simple at first the questions only get more complicated with time when my interviewer to add capacitors inductors left right all over the circuit and me to analyze the circuit behavior  analog interview after introducing myself we discussed one of the most rudimentary grade topics rc rl circuits  only round of technical interviews for both profiles  shortlisted for both the digital analog profiles  technical interview round for our batch besides our online screening test scores resume shortlisting also  comprised problems one would usually find in any gmat test coupled with few reading comprehension data analysis questions  the aptitude section relatively easy compared to the other two  the digital section mostly consists of questions based on combinational sequential logic circuit design analysis especially fsms and covers some basic topics from sta  the questions in the analog section will test your fundamentals on basic analog topics such as rc rl circuits biasing circuits of bjts mosfets and analysis of op amp based circuits including both ideal non ideal conditions  online screening test st round since applied for both the analog digital profiles my st round included hour long online test with sections analog min digital min aptitude min  interview round this an hr round we discussed about the roles and locations and why would you the right person for the role and some behavioural questions  this round similar to the previous round we discussed about the database design of my project along with some dbms questions and writing some sql queries then he some basic questions on os oops and write one or two basic c programs while sharing screen  interview round in this round the interviewer didn have my resume so he me to go through my resume  this round revolved around everything in my resume he questions from dbms sql operating systems and some data structures and also to share screen and code them the data structures questions easy ones they just wanted to see if you can code  we brief discussion about my projects and interests  interview round the interview around  around people shortlisted for interviews  section two easy medium coding questions  section consisted of various mcq questions from computer networks aptitude and some from operating systems  online test this round on hackerrank there two sections the selection procedure an online test for all eligible candidates and two technical interview rounds and one hr interview round for the shortlisted students  the final list of selected candidates released on the same night and finally from apps and from st selected  at the end of each of the rounds made sure to the interviewer few meaningful questions regarding the role and the company  then he questioned me on one of my previous semester course digital system and design and ended up the interview after short discussion about my future goals  then he questioned me on basics of os and dbms  then to give brief description on one of my projects  round similar to first interview he me to introduce myself  then he me to explain about foreign key dbms and finally the interview ended up with basic question on python vs c  after this he questioned me on oops concepts inheritance and difference between overloading and overriding  later to explain binary trees and implement easy dsa questions based on binary trees  round the interviewer me to introduce myself  finally students shortlisted for the application engineer profile and students shortlisted for the server technology profile  furthermore each section divided into subsections with given time constraint  the code output section focused majorly on the concept of trees avl bst  the questions divided into four sections english communication core cs concepts aptitude and code output based section  online test oracle s online test is totally based on mcq pattern  there common online test for these profiles followed by separate set of interviews technical hr rounds for the application development profile and technical rounds for the server technology profile oracle came to campus for separate profiles application engineer and server technology  round technical interview again about my projects and basic power electronics  some basic and in depth questions based on my projects  round technical interview to describe the projects in my resume in brief by the interview panel  round gd the topic is globalization boon or curse round online test consisted of aptitude verbal english understanding and technical sections  the results came like hrs later and total of interns selected he further extended the question of finding the maximum in given range and explained him segment tree logic of this and he satisfied and finally few questions on myntra like the tech stack and how does the work changes on seasonal sales in office and the interview concluded with that org sliding window maximum maximum of all subarrays of size k explained him the logic and he satisfied org search in row wise and column wise sorted matrix explained him o nlog approach but he me to optimize further but struggled here and for hint and then coded the logic  technical interview dsa and problem solving only the interviewer straight away me dsa question based on matrix https www  candidates moved on to the next round then there mins left few questions on myntra work culture  question medium to hard level question based on dp on strings explained him my approach using recursion and memoization and coded out com problems minimum characters required to make string palindromic explained him all possible approach edge cases and finally coded using two pointer method  st question https www  the interviewer with my intro and straight away jumped on to dsa  technical interview dsa and problem solving only conducted on the hackerrank codepair platform  total of students shortlisted  managed to questions completely and passed test cases in the one  online coding round this for hour and dsa related mcqs and coding questions of varying difficulty from easy easy medium medium hard  online coding round and technical interviews there rounds in total  no puzzles to me  given different kinds of scenarios and how would react to them  the interviewer wanted to evaluate how deal with different types of problems  then we discussed lot of behavioral questions  final hr round in this round first to explain one of my projects and few follow up questions on that  this round more like discussion rather than round  at last if any questions for them  came up with way where binary search can implemented which will make this operation fast interviewer pretty impressed with this approach  we discussed different approaches using linked list hashmap  then to design data structure to retrieve data from database when particular type of query is coming frequently  few basic questions on dbms  we also discussed whether greedy will work or should we go for dp  then given dsa question based on sorting which figured out pretty quickly  technical interview this interviewer pretty chill than the last round to code the logic to find the middle two nodes of linkedlist single pass  at last to implement few basic oops concepts in c like inheritance constructors  after that trapping rainwater problem for which all the approaches  told my interviewer twice that practiced most of the question in interviewbit platform but she said s okay and didn want to see my interviewbit profile  then to show my leetcode profile where have solved around questions  shared my screen and used an online whiteboard to explain which slightly impressed the interviewer  few questions on dmbs also after which to explain dfs bfs their complexities and comparisons  find the middle element of linked list double pass approach first then interviewer me to optimize so the single pass approach also using slow fast pointer  find if loop exits hashing approach and fast slow pointer approach  then question on linked lists  also to write code for the same  technical interview to explain one of my projects then given simple array question screening test coding ques mcqs coding ques link click here mcqs based on cs core concepts  at the end of each of the rounds made sure to the interviewer few meaningful questions regarding the role and the company  since machine learning as one of my interests also questions like the current state of ai ai in the next years  we also general discussion regarding new emerging tech  hr round this pure hr round wide variety of questions such as why oracle state your weaknesses  post this stack based question and another similar variant  since the interviewer nitk alumnus we brief conversation regarding the college online classes  technical round similar to the first round the interviewer me to give brief introduction about myself and questioned me about one of my projects why particular technology used difficulties faced  the interviewer then me to list out the differences between c and c and finally the interview ended with simple puzzle cut cake into equal pieces using cuts  also to write the pseudocode stating the difference for the latter  after this questioned on oop s concepts polymorphism and operator overloading vs overriding  later to implement easy dsa questions on strings and bit manipulation based  technical round the interviewer me to introduce myself with focus on my projects  finally students shortlisted for the application engineer profile and students shortlisted for the server technology profile  furthermore each section divided into subsections with given time constraint  the code output section focused heavily on the concept of trees binary trees avl bst and red black trees  the questions divided into four sections english communication core cs concepts aptitude and code output based section  online test oracle s online test did not consist of the traditional coding questions rather the questions all mcqs  there common online test for these profiles followed by separate set of interviews technical hr rounds for the application development profile and technical rounds for the server technology profile oracle came to campus for separate profiles application engineer and server technology  the interviewers also very friendly  the whole round completed in an hour  finally they me about my plans after college  they also some theory questions on os  they focused more on linked list questions  they me coding questions which where pretty standard questions  make sure you know whatever you have in your resume  they about my projects in my resume  they by asking me to introduce myself  technical hr round so there interviewers  round only one round of interview which conducted on microsoft teams  overall the test pretty easy  the test comprised of aptitude some programming output questions and coding questions round screening test conducted on hackerrank platform  all this on codility platform with language of your choice  this took some time and when proper running code he about my idea  he told me to show working code first  the interviewer did not about the approach  we need to figure out the hidden agenda inside the question and then start to code  the third round complex question  basic dsa theory and few hr questions also  however instead of speaking while writing the code told to initially fully explain the idea and then code and show its running with different test cases  the second round also similar with bfs question  not to run and but they wanted an explanation for certain lines in the code  in the first round given words inside brackets and to decompress the string from the inside expanding words in the process  each round fundamental question which we can answer directly or write in single line of code and more challenging question  the interview phase three rounds min each  using other ide s allowed  so sure to check the code correctly for errors before submitting  unlike other companies here we can only submit the answer once  we need to find the next highest number such that the number has no same consecutive numbers  the second question little tricky  we need to find the maximal subset and the answer involved simple bit manipulation  the first question fundamental and straightforward  two questions given with mins time first there an online coding round held on codility platform  then why wanted to join bajaj ? already answers prepared for these kind of general hr questions and hence able to answer confidently and impressively  there couple of questions regarding my summer internship as well which in the business domain  about my journey so far in nitk and why chose mechanical engineering  this again one on one interview with an hr personnel  round hr interview those who performed well in the technical interview sent an invite for final hr interview in about half an hour  if you haven been able to work on any project s make sure to super thorough with key concepts you would have learnt in year  the interview lasted for about minutes and the interviewer very friendly and as with most interviews provided answers to couple of questions wasn able to answer  based on the projects that in my past year  round technical interview those who cleared the psychometric test given time slots for one on one technical interview  certain questions repeat with different wordings and you need to make sure that your answers consistent  there is no right or wrong answer in this test but make sure you answer honestly and take all the time you need to think  this test self paced took about an hour and minutes guess and the questions about general outlook on life and attitude in certain situations  those who cleared this forwarded mail in minutes to appear for psychometric test personality test  you could utilize in the best way you would see fit  the total time duration minutes  this test audio and video proctored and questions mcq type  st test consisted of parts english logical reasoning quantitative aptitude and technical mechanical round online test there tests for bajaj auto only company in my knowledge to have so  no questions based on my resume or theory questions  in this round to find the maximum value in the window of size k using deque and the next to find if said number is in matrix where rows and columns sorted in ascending order  interview this interview again consisted of being to questions  the interviewer really chill  the second dp question where given string we need to partition into k string and we need to convert these strings into palindrome as the previous question we need to find way to split this string in such that we minimise the number of character added to convert the k strings into palindrome is minimum  the first one to find the minimum number of characters to added to the end of string to make palindrome  st interview the interviewer me dsa questions  managed to questions fully and questions partially  online test lasted for minutes and consisted of mcqs and dsa questions easy medium the recruitment process for interns involved test and interviews  then the interviewer concluded with some general hr based questions  round technical interview min this interview mainly focused on sql and few algorithmic and output based questions in c as have in my resume  at last we small discussion on my interests  after that the interviewer me to dry run on some special cases  round technical interview min at first we brief discussion on my projects then given coding question on strings that could executed on any online platform  data structures primarily focussed on binary trees  os oops dbms networking  english and communication skills  each subset its own time for solving  all questions divided into subsets round this an mcq test in which we to about questions in minutes  there wasn an hr round for interns  selected for the digital electronics profile  no questions from my resume  questions also from opamp circuits cmos logic gates cmos inverter characteristics nand gate nor gate and why cmos nand is preferred over cmos nor gate  the analog electronics interview consisted of lots of rc rl circuit questions  then find the number of boolean functions that can defined for n boolean variables if the output takes forms and z  find the number of boolean functions that can defined for n boolean variables  design overlapping pattern detector and how will you implement its hardware  construct input nand gate using input nand gates hence find the number of input nand gates required to make an n input nand gate  reduce the boolean expression mn p np derive the circuit for the expression using logic gates and detect static hazard for the circuit  design mod up counter plot the output waveform of each flip flop of that counter find the frequency and duty cycle of the output derive circuit to make the duty cycle of the mod counter output from  explain what is universal logic gate implement an exor gate using nand gates  round technical interview the digital electronics interview went on for hour minutes  questions in the digital section from number systems boolean algebra combinational circuits static timing analysis flip flops counters finite state machines  questions in the analog section from rc rl rlc circuits opamps and transistors bjt and mosfet  shortlisted for both analog and digital after round  people shortlisted for digital people shortlisted for analog  one can selected in any one of analog or digital or both  the hardware test sections analog questions minutes digital questions minutes and aptitude questions minutes with the aptitude section being compulsory  st round included online test resume shortlisting  there no hr round for the interns  as this rd interview without any break couldn exactly think straight and wasn able to few of the questions  then there few application based questions using counters flip flops and other digital components which on the difficult side  the digital interview began with little introduction and few questions based on the project that in the resume  unfortunately the moment round finished called for digital interview  then he me few conceptual questions on embedded c  interview advanced topics on dsa which quite difficult as wasn very proficient with dsa  just after finishing this called for interview in the software profile  found this interview fairly on the easier side as my concept clear on these topics  next an analog interview that mainly focused on rlc circuits basic opamps and some other application based questions  later he me little bit about the projects that in the resume  then he me few computer architecture questions which mainly focused on caches functionality types  round shortlisted for all the profiles software interview first where they me basic c problems involving linked lists and problem solving type questions  of these aptitude and software sections fairly simple digital being moderate and analog quite tricky and required you to know the concepts in depth  chose both as fairly confident on both the profiles  st round you can choose between software hardware or both with mandatory aptitude section  there no hr round for interns  the interviewer wanted to see if knew the basics and if can apply them to complex problems  round analog consisted of questions from rlc circuits given an input voltage to plot the output voltage  only shortlisted for the analog profile  in the analog domain to describe my project and there questions from filters rlc circuits diodes and opamps  coming to round in the software domain c programming questions and some questions from computer organization and architecture  to design bit or gate from bit or gates and multiplexers which of moderate difficulty  in round for the digital domain questions about logic gates ex  shortlisted for all three profiles  the software section of the test little bit easy there basic output based questions in c language  the questions tricky and time consuming  the analog section the difficult part of the test there questions from rlc circuits opamps and diodes  the digital section consisted of questions from logic gates counters gate delays and flip flops  both aptitude and digital sections of moderate difficulty  one could attempt any one or all of the optional sections round consisted of one mandatory section aptitude and three optional sections analog digital embedded software  overall as long as you clearly convey what you to the interviewers and show them that your concepts sound will easy  also question based on anti aliasing  few questions based on op amps which extremely basic  from v graphs at various locations to frequency responses of in the s plane  during the interview lot of rlc circuits and to analyze them  based on the profile you applying for have to attend some or all of the sections the written test sections analog digital aptitude and software  there no hr round for the interns  at the end of the interview he if any query to which some questions regarding the company and after that the interview ended  this response made me confused at that time and said its contradictory to what remember to which he responded that he is sure that does not get concatenated after getting this response realized that he is checking my temper so told that may remember c and after that manually concatenated the null character at the end of the string and him if this is what he wanted and to my shock he laughing and moved on to the next question which simple bit manipulation question  he went silent for sometime and if the null character would also get copied or not to which replied no since the null character automatically gets concatenated at the end of the the array which is correct answer for this question and to my surprise he said that no does not happen  the first question to reverse the given string without using library functions which quickly coded made another character array of same length and copied all the values in reverse order and him if this is what he wanted  since not used c for about years him if could use some other language like java but he still insisted me to use c and so decided to go with c  he then told me that he wants me to code some program in c  able to answer all of the questions and after this he me to share my screen and open normal text editor like notepad  the interview also the first question to explain my project and after finished explaining they some questions related to like why chose to use this hardware and other similar questions  able to answer most the questions in the first interview and after the interview ended got message from the spoc that they want another round for me  the st interview more project focused like the first question itself to explain my arduino project and the following questions all related to my project  the and rd rounds interview rounds and never thought that would ever able to pass them since not preparing for embedded software but both of the rounds great  the first section aptitude mcq and the second section basic programming mcq  st round an online test which sections  she basically me some typical hr questions and my preferences and interests you can just chill and talk to the interviewer in this round there is no right or wrong answer its just them getting to know u one tip is just look up the company and the roles they offering before hand usually the jd on the iris is enough  hr round this pretty quick round of about mins  few questions and then over  after this he questions like tell me an instance where u worked in team and wt w uld u do if someone slacking and that is affecting the progress of the project ? mention an instance when your fast learning skills came in clutch told him some experiences and talked about some general things and then he if any questions for him then he went on to me some design questions how would you implement speech to text converter ? what the prerequisites ?what the challenges ?some other design questions from my projects  when told him he laughed and said that to trust my math and tell him that there no soln  then he went on to give me some two puzzles solved the first question pretty quickly he impressed then the second question kinda got tricked linear algebra problem in disguise no solution wasnt getting any soln  webdev project using reactjs so he how does react optimize rendering in dom expected to know about virtual dom and all  they very deep questions on the projects for ex  st half of the interview spent on my resume and projects  round manager round this pretty chill round  explained the concept fully then he me to give some examples of dp problems for this blanked out completely what is topological sort and when is used ? wasn really sure even though problem based on topological sort before he told u can use in scheduling that s when hit me and remembered what and ended up kinda convincing him know what is  he some dsa questions like what is dp ?explain he me some questions on some design choices we made like the technologies used and why did we make those choices he me about my ongoing projects that hadn in my resume  there also dbms questions as told taken dbms course in my minors course and some os questions what is concurrency ? methods to achieve and explain  interview rounds st round about my interests and some questions based on my interests online test round coding round coding questions cp based mcqs based on networking os oops dbms pretty straight forward easy questions  after that small hr interview where they typical hr questions like conflict resolution in the workspace  then we an interview round all questions related to the work on my resume  after the st test another psychometric test taken  aptitude easy technical section questions from power electronics machines and few related to hardware communication protocols  aptitude and technical questions first we test of minutes  finally they took people for the software role  all the coding questions standard questions  at last coding questions  then few questions like how would you find out whether your system is using little endian or big endian ordering  again coa based questions  intro and resume questions  round this also similarly  members shortlisted for the rd round  and then theory questions mainly on coa and some on os also  followed by coding questions  round first to introduce myself then few questions based on my resume  members shortlisted for the round  round the online test sections aptitude and software for those who applied only for software role the selection procedure rounds in total online test interview rounds  round hr you will few basic hr questions along with your preferred location higher study plans  so know your resume well  also about extracurriculars in my resume  named manager round where the interviewer manager understands your ability to work in group and the thought process behind every decision during your project course  round purely based on my resume  there simple dsa questions too  ex list forbidden ans you cannot choose round technical round covering all computer science subjects mainly memory allocation pointers and oops  you will provided with list of binary strings you need to generate new binary string such that has least differences when compared to the given list also there forbidden list of binary strings you cannot create binary string that is part of the forbidden list  the given question boils down to this  find the time required to reach z tickets  once you have that many tickets you can exchange them for new token machine that can also produce y tokens sec  you also provided with threshold x  you given basic token generator that produces tokens sec round an online screening round setup on hacker rank with mcqs covering networks os dbms output prediction and coding questions  there no hr interviews for interns and candidates selected from digital profile again this number is bit more than that of previous year  if you know certain topic you can say no and he won grill you in that topic  always make sure you couple of questions to the interviewer whenever he gives you the permission to do so  the questions of easy moderate level  he ended the interview with puzzle  right after my introduction he jumped into technical questions covering latches flip flops fsm mealy moore and pattern detectors mosfet sta setup and hold time analysis for circuits with multiple flip flops cmos and rc circuits  round interview no questions from my resume  questions from gates flip flops counter fsm sta  aptitude some basic data interpretation problems and paragraph type problems  candidates shortlisted for interviews in digital profile this number more than the previous year so might not same for your year  you can selected in any one of digital or analog or both  aptitude and digital sections of moderate level  analog paper on the tougher side  there of negative marks  analog and digital questions each for minutes each  aptitude is compulsory and questions for minutes round online test resume shortlisting online test three sections analog digital and aptitude  rd round lasted for around mins in which mins is focused on project discussion and the rest is for copying string to another in c without using any inbuilt functions and the size of the strings is unknown  round is face to face interview where they basics of c questions on datatypes initialization pointers typecasting inline functions macros and some input output questions and some microprocessor stuff there is an online test and resume filtering total of people selected in all profiles around in sw  there no hr round for me  for me there only one round of interview each for analog and digital one question on fifo data structure  in digital questions on sta register counters fsm verilog and memories cache  based on output waveforms of different rc circuits one from network theory one from opamp and last one to describe the working of given cmos circuit qualitatively at first got selected only for analog domain and later for digital too in extended shortlist  round this technical interview round based on your performance you may get selected for analog digital or both there questions in each section with time limit min for aptitude min each of analog and digital  for hardware profile there sections analog digital and aptitude round an mcq test on hirepro platform  interview round this hr round which pretty much just generic hr questions on why would good fit for the company what can expect of the company and what is expected of me  this mostly resume based round and then about my roles in these projects and some small talk on the various technologies cisco deals with  again some questions based on my projects  interview round this part managerial part technical round  finally around minutes spent on some very basic dsa and algo questions  then questioned on various os topics and their applications  touched most topics in my projects and delved into the theory behind them  we talked about my interests and projects for the first minutes  my first interview around am and technical round  interview round the interviews held on cisco webex and instructions given on webex space  around people shortlisted for the interview round online test the first round on hackerrank and consisted of few aptitude questions some networking and os related questions and coding questions  the results came like hrs later and total of interns selected  then the solution using hash maps and optimized using heaps and he looked satisfied with my solution and the interview concluded with that  he later introduced some extra constraints but due to lack of time he told me to leave  after that he me weird frequency related problem which could easily solved using hashing  kept for few minutes with the interviewer constantly helping me and finally got the solution  him the dp solution using arrays but he me to do using just array  this interviewer got straight to the point and me the coin change problem  technical interview this interview based on ds algo and held on codepair too  candidates moved on to the next round  the hr time got over when still struggling with the one s code but he seemed very satisfied with my logic  after that he two medium level questions based on stack this one previously and the other based on binary trees and bst which on the tougher side  the interviewer pretty chill and me to just casually talk for the first mins to get comfortable  technical interview this virtual interview based on problem solving and conducted on the hackerrank codepair platform  total of students shortlisted of which on the waitlist  managed to questions completely and passed test cases in the one  though coding questions may seem like much in an hour they could if one has an excellent grasp on dsa  online coding test this test for hour and programming related mcqs and coding questions of varying difficulty from easy easy medium medium hard  online coding round and technical interviews and no hr round for interns there rounds in total  he very friendly and worry if you get stuck he will guide you and all they want is to see your approach rather than the final answer frequency dividers mod and mod counters full circuits diagrams and timing related timing diagrams signed and unsigned numbers s and s complement system and number of bits in result for multiplying two bit numbers number of bits required for result after adding bit numbers then bit numbers and then deriving general expression for adding n bit numbers next to make input nand using only input nand then input input and derive mathematical expression to calculate number of input nand gates required to make n input nand make or and and logics from mux later told to derive those without using  he by asking simple questions and later built up on them  coming to questions we on counters johnson ring and decade fsm this looked complex but if you read the question twice you will figure out that isn that hard number system error detection parity and hamming codes mux static timing analysis there almost or questions from sta flipflops finding next states after few clock pulses bit parallel adder and few on outputs of circuits with delays of each component glitch free output  would say wasn that easy to all the questions in minutes so its very important to select the questions depending on the concepts which your most sure about and finish them first and attempt the lengthier ones later so that you can make sure that you have solved minimum number of questions in digital there questions in digital with minutes time to  coming to the test aptitude section of questions and minutes time  applied for digital so attempted digital and aptitude only  hardware has both analog and digital sections and you can attempt whichever you interested both also and aptitude section is mandatory to attempt irrespective of the profile you have applied for round technical test depending on the profile you applied for software hardware or both  round interview technical and hr interviews happened on the same day in couple of hours after the interview results announced round written test of minutes with questions of technical questions quantitative reasoning english rest logical and aptitude questions round psychometric test the once who qualified in this first test got link to start writing the psychometric test in the next half hour with sets of questions we got half hour window to start with our both test  technical round coding question medium hard  st technical round coding question medium  online test mcq and coding question easy medium  online coding test and technical rounds  round ended with few hard hr questions like questions framed in such way that one cannot diplomatic one question if cisco pays you more and other company which pays less allows you to do work of your interest what will you choose round hr round duration minutes normal hr questions and work location preferences  he interested about everything on resume about club what do in club other activities on my resume  functionalities of various components of projects questions related to tech stacks of the projects along with this he about real life use cases of projects how we can further improve the projects  rd round managerial project round duration minutes questions related to projects in great depth  expected to start from brute force and optimise as much as possible and also to cover all boundary cases in dsa questions  st round coding round coding questions cp based mcqs based on networking os oops dbms and mcqs on cryptography round technical interview mins questions based on projects in depth also few dsa questions of medium hard level along with core cs concepts in the first round an online test in which there analog digital and aptitude section shortlisted for analog then three rounds of interviews in first two rounds there technical questions based on rc circuits basics of op amps input output impedance calculation and basics of network analysis filters  there no hr round for me  the digital interview covered sta registers counters designing frequency dividers fsm verilog fifo data structure and memories cache  the analog interview covered input and output waveforms of various rc circuits questions on the opamp circuits and internal working of opamps and some general electronics questions  some others two as well  only one round for digital and analog each  the second round technical interview round  shortlisted for analog and on the extended shortlist for digital for the hardware profile the first round written round with sections digital analog and aptitude  for interns there no hr round  later the interviewers me hint  even when coding one of the questions made mistake and the output never came  then asking some advanced os and coa which couldn answer  c programming especially pointers and linked list  the interviewer me to write c program to generate random number without using any inbuilt functions  shortlisted for software profile and round tougher  in software they about c programming microprocessors coa os  round in digital to design sequence detector latches vs flipflops mealy and moore design dac and adc cmos rc circuits  selected for digital and software profiles  filled with rc rl circuits and questions tricky  analog the toughest part  software part easy when compared to analog and digital  you could choose only software or software hardware or only hardware round mcq based test and sections out of which only section aptitude compulsory  keep calm and give your best  my laptop shut down in the middle of both the technical rounds and they understood the issues  the whole process very peaceful and all the interviewers very supportive  reflects negatively if you question  questions like how s your work life balance in or what s your favorite thing about  if any questions as other people would have told you always keep some questions ready  some more questions about my approach to problems and how deal with arguments  scared to questions if you re not clear on some point  whenever clarifying question answered after properly and in detail  took my time and explained each step of the way  then to make the bus ticketing system online and what changes will reflected on the database  to create the schemas and explain where exactly would store details like route numbers timings and other similar stuff  then the hr me to create system design for bus ticketing system  once that again questions on my resume but this time the questions more focused on why the project chosen how went about what made the project unique and what is the future scope of the project  hr hm round this round off by asking the general hr questions there only dsa question in this round  again about oops and its real life implementations  he me to write queries for mongodb which the database used and about situation where innovated and helped any project along  databases and aws included in my projects which focused heavily upon  technical round this round more resume focused for me  all the coding in this round just pseudocode and nothing compiled  then simple puzzle that just binary search in disguise  able to quickly revise the concepts and see what to concentrate on ly syjalf helped me lot in preparing for oops similar sheets also helped me for dbms and os  this sheet by love babbar on whimsical https bit  then he me lot in detail about oops  the interviewer first me some dsa questions related to linked lists and strings  helps you if you sound confident  always prepare an introduction and brief description about your skills  st technical round this face to face interview and hour long com discuss interview question algorithms ascend online assessment product of palindromes  the coding question to find the maximum product of two non overlapping palindromic subsequences  written the written round consisted of coding question mcqs about basic concepts like oops dbms data structures output questions there total of rounds in the internship process  to some questions and say no to this  every rounded ended with interviewer asking do have any question  to design data schema in backend for bus booking system  this round mainly focused on projects in my resume and about my interests  hr round interviewer very friendly and made me comfortable  have to code few of the above and explain time complexity for each question  simple array based question two linked list questions implementing queue with linked list  technical round interview with interviewer introduction followed by my introduction  have to code both of them on some online tool which is shared by them and dry run  one question based on sorting application and other on greedy  interviewer friendly and made me comfortable  technical round interview with my introduction and briefly about my projects  there no hr interview for our profile server technology online assessment coding question based on dynamic programming and mcqs on computer science fundamentals like c oops dbms os networking  lastly he me to write bubble sort in c  the interviewer me coding question based on practical scenario and to write code in my preferred language  round second technical interview this round with discussion about the projects on my resume  later some cs theory questions about dsa sorting algorithms dbms what is relational db and where is used basic networking question and os what is process ? interviewer pretty chill he didn grill much about concepts that didn know and the round lasted for about mins  then discussed my resume and about my projects  he told me to share my screen and write c code in notepad  round technical interview the interviewer with fundamental coding question print given list in reverse order  the time limit set for each sub section which bit inconvenient  and each of these sections sub sections  aptitude and understanding code most questions tree based  the test sections english computer science theory oops os dbms they about my fields of intrests and why you want to join visaround online test different from other software companies no coding questions one problem statement given and to explain and about the projects that have in the resume  round technical hr they one dp question which minimum number of fountains to activated so submitting early helped me one modification of knapsack and the other maximal sqaure with and in matrix the questions at standard level i got questions based on dp time minutes for the questions  st round coding test which coding questions there rounds for the sde internship  round hr interview this short interview with some standard hr questions interests strengths weaknesses situation based questions  the interview ended with some talks about tech stack used at oracle  after writing code for the whole interview the interviewer seemed satisfied with my approach and clean readable code  then given hard and bulky string problem to code  round technical interview this round began with interviewer asking about my technical interests  the interview ended with some talks about life at oracle  then to code and explain easy dsa questions in time of minutes each followed by puzzle problems  round technical interview this round with brief discussion about my projects  good time management really needed to clear this test  each of the sections and subsections timed  round online test this mcq only test of vast variety of questions from english communication dsa mostly binary tree and avl tree logical reasoning aptitude os dbms  selection procedure for both the profiles an online test followed by interview rounds oracle came on campus for profiles application development and server technology  this interview round lasted for around mins  round technical interview again some standard resume questions and easy dsa and os oop questions  this round lasted for mins  then an easy dsa question and bunch of questions on os oops  system design questions and explained entities attributes required and other aspects like cache memory required no of requests and rest api  also questions about my gsoc project and my responsibilities as an iris team member  round technical interview the interviewer focused on my resume and me to explain more about an exciting project that ve worked on after going through my resume  some dsa questions based on avl trees and there questions where you to select the correct java code snippet for various tree operations and some questions also on flow charts and logical sequences of an algorithm round online test with mcq type questions to completed within mins ranging from english proficiency aptitude computer science fundamentals and dsa  questions like short term long term goals what value you would add to the company strengths weaknesses few basic questions on fluid dynamics thermal engineering software programming integration experience  further technical questions about the projects  broadly these the topics that about very elaborate explanation of my projects  rd round technical interview this lasted for around mins for me  round group discussion on the topic agriculture vs manufacturing industry in india priorities for the future  the technical section wide range of questions from almost all domains of mechanical engineering  the logical reasoning and quantitative questions straightforward but speed key  st round online test divided into sections verbal ability basic english grammar logical reasoning quantitative analysis and technical section  with this the interview rounds came to an end  came up with brute force solution to this question  there can multiple toppers  find out the topper for each subject  upgraded question you given list of students and their scores in multiple subjects  after implementing the algorithm he upgraded the problem and to just mention the ds and the algorithm no need to code  implement the algorithm for the solution  select the ds for the output  select the ideal ds to the question  tasks select the ds for the input parameters  there can multiple toppers  find out the topper  question you given list of students and their score in single subject  after the discussion he me coding question which could code in any text editor and language  since of my projects involved the use of websockets the interviewer questions on this topic  round technical interview min similar to the previous round the interviewer me to explain about all the projects  then we small discussion on data encryption and spatial databases  to perform dry run of the code for few test cases  ipv addressing the main challenge to enumerate and account for various corner cases  question given an input string check if s valid ip address  after the discussion he me coding question which could code in any text editor and language  he then questioned me on particular aspect in one of the project  in particular he wanted me to briefly describe the project tech stack used challenges faced and key takeaways  round technical interview min the interviewer me to speak about all the projects in my resume  all four sections mcq based no coding at all round online assessment min this round an aptitude test of sections contextual communication se aptitude cs knowledge and coding skills in gyan reviews for introduction and please do non generic questions as this is the true indictaor that you have true interest in the company  used the strategy described by abhishek kumar https iris  every interviewer with introduced yourself and ended with do you have any questions for us please utilise this opportunity to stand out  draw some real life examples express your advantages show how would good team contributer as well as good leader  narration is the key here you have to converse with the interviwer rather than just n  the interviewer wanted to see how would respond different scenarios and how would react when faced with adversities  round this round purely hr  he then went on to about what know about oracle and replied using the knowledge from the ppt attended  tried writing comment lines also and he impressed and appreciated the documentation  he quite friendly and kept reminding me of values forgot to update or lines forgot  the interviewer me to implement an atm vending machine using oops and some constraints  this more on how would implement oops concepts given scenario  later given an easy question on strings and one apti question on detecting pattern in number sequence round this also technical interview  then he focused on the one web dev project where used mysql db and ror framework and tried to see if knew the ins and outs  round this technical interview in which the interviewer tried to get to know my projects in detail  knowing all the basics and quick hand eye coordination should get you through the round  there section entirely based on avl trees so nothing can taken lightly  these sub sections covered almost every cs fundamentals in dsa dbms os  so you have to quick and utilise your mcq skills round this very fast paced online round which different sections nested within which there sub sections and each of the sub sections timed and the time cannot carried forward to other sections nor can we get back to the sections answered or the questions answered  the discussion went on for another minutes which believe helped me make good impression  the interviewer then me if have questions and since there time left took the opportunity to some questions about the company and his role at the company  lasted for minutes  all basic hr questions one can think of what your strengths weaknesses why do you wanna join oracle  round hr this completely an hr round  this round minutes long  could not answer all questions completely in this round but the interviewer kind enough to help me reach conclusion for each of the questions  the only dsa question got to optimize sparse matrix for which just to write the logic and not code out fully  there hardly any dsa questions in this round and mostly questioned on core cs concepts like networks os and dbms  round technical here again for my introduction followed by brief discussion about my resume  this round minutes long  also some questions about strings and this mostly derived from the behaviour of strings in java  post this to write sql queries for few questions  you would ve such questions in assignments of cs in your first year  round technical the interviewer me for my introduction discussed my resume and me to write pseudo code for basic programs  since got shortlisted for the former rounds of interviews  the shortlists for both roles mutually exclusive  around students shortlisted in total for the applications engineering role and for server technology  all in all of easy medium difficulty but we to quick while answering the questions  we to answer questions that completed the flowchart  the software engineering aptitude section certain requirements given along with an incomplete flowchart  all questions followed the same question pattern and with strong basics this section could easily answered  the dsa section mcqs that mainly tested knowledge of trees binary trees bst avl  the cs core section questions from basic networks os dsa and oops  the english comprehension and aptitude questions quite easy but lengthy  the test divided into sections english comprehension cs core logical aptitude software engineering aptitude  online test their online test quite unique compared to the other tests  both of these roles one common online test followed by separate set of interviews oracle came in with two roles server technology intern and applications engineering intern  in the end some hr based questions  also few questions on core cs concepts os and dbms  then questions on my projects and the six month internship did the previous semester  fundamental back end validation question for food delivery application  round technical hr interview the interviewer already gone through my resume  around students got shortlisted in this round  one from graph theory and the other one pattern matching algorithm  round online assessment two basic dsa questions there just two rounds  make sure you have something to when the interviewer asks any questions for us ?  finally some hr questions  this followed by some more technical questions based on my resume  then to explain my code along with the time complexity  in this round to implement coding problems on the hackerank codepair platform  the interview with introductions and the interviewer senior so knew what coming my way ! he went through my resume and discussed my interests and my favourite subjects  the second round tech hr interview the first round consisted of coding problems  server tech profile interns only rounds no hr either while apps rd hr round  this interview ended within half an hour as around their lunch break time  he then me an open ended system design question and me to code the whole approach in preferred language of my choice  round interview my interviewer once more with discussion of what on my resume and few more questions on one particular project that  this interview the longest and went on for an hour  he ended the interview with few os based questions  to share my screen and code the whole program including the main function taking inputs in language of my choice  he then proceeded to me dsa questions simple array based question and backtracking question  he me to give brief overview of all the projects on my resume but discussed in deep about my summer internship  round interview my interviewer off the interview by discussing whatever on my resume  we got to know the same day of those shortlisted for interviews for apps for server tech and on the waitlist for apps profile  they all mcqs however each section subsections that each their own time limit not enough time to read the questions and analyze in detail you ll have to quick  the round sections english communication based aptitude computer science theory core os dbms oops mainly and finally understanding code output based heavily tree based  minutes long and proctored if your face at some point isn seen clearly does not allow you to answer see any of the questions  round online assessment round this different from the coding rounds we so far  applied for both and got shortlisted for interviews under server technology  either you can apply for one of the two roles or if you apply for both roles you will randomly shortlisted for one of the two roles for interviews  they appear as separate applications on iris but both having the same initial online assessment round oracle india takes interns for roles server technology and application development  very desperate for the results they announced at pm and candidates selected  so the process finished in hr  him about projects he did in his college time and how digital payments works we discussed around mins  as not any cliche hr ques this question becomes never to say no thing  then he me do have any questions  then he me sql queries told him that not good in syntax as never wrote one so he me hint and told me to just explain how will approach  later to optimized so used dp and optimized  firstly told him brute force approach then coded  then he me dsa question to count the number of ways to reach nth step you can jump or steps at time  as explaining the features he asking me questions on various scenarios where can improve the scalability of project basically he wanted to see my creativity more than mins we discussed on projects about tech stacks and libraries which have used and how they work  round technical hr as usual the interview with intros then interviewer me about my projects my projects deployed so him to share my screen and walkthrough of the whole project  as the questions standard able to do them in around mins  one standard knapsack and another one math problem round coding test online test conducted on hackerrank and consisted medium level dsa questions  this round very peaceful just some standard hr questions  round this the hr round  at the end of the round he me to explain project in my resume  to write some sql queries and then the interviewer me some paging related questions os  round in this round the questions based on dbms and os  to print matrix in spiral form find the height of binary tree check if two strings anagrams and implement any sorting algorithm  the ds questions mainly on trees avl tree and red black tree round this round an online interview where mainly simple dsa questions and puzzles  the topics verbal ability logical reasoning quantitative aptitude and computer science fundamentals dbms os ds round this round online test which mcq questions  with that the interview process over  the interview ended with discussion on how the work culture is in oracle and the role of an intern at oracle  questions from computer architecture and finite automata along with small discussion about my resume  the interviewer really chill and friendly  round technical interview this round much more chill compared to the first round  the interview ended with an informal discussion between me and the interviewer and went ahead to the interview round  towards the end probably due to lack of time the interview s pace picked up and slightly overwhelming but manageable  few dsa questions at first told to code in notepad and then the interviewer went on to questions quite lot of them on os oops and memory management in c c  round technical interview the interviewer slightly intimidating but nevertheless friendly enough  around people shortlisted for the interview rounds  the round is heavily proctored and has tight time constraint so time management became quite important  the test divided into sections and tested us in dsa os dbms aptitude and logical reasoning skills along with english proficiency as well  both the profiles an online test followed by interviews personally interviews round online test the online test purely mcq based oracle india came with two profiles server technology and application development  the final list of selected candidates released on the same night and finally from apps and from st selected  application development profile interns both third round and hr as well  server technology profile interns did not have third round or an hr round  overall the second round tested more profile specific skills and requires deep understanding of everything that s on your resume  finally an oops based question  actually didn fully get this question but the interviewer kind enough to let me write the code for in c  then to write sql query to find the type of node in binary tree  make sure that your individual contribution is highlighted when you talk about any project  to explain in detail one of my favourite projects from my resume  round technical interview this round bit shorter than the previous one because we running short on time  overall the first round breeze and knowing the basics of dsa dbms and knowing what s on your resume will do  few questions related to my previous internship in my resume  to write all the code in notepad sharing my screen and not to execute any of the code that wrote  the interviewer very kind he actually an nitk alumnus and he allowed me to fully explore my approaches to any question before he me to using different way  the dbms question simple join based question where to retrieve an aggregate value by joining tables  the second dsa question evaluation of postfix notation expressions using stacks  the first dsa question balanced parentheses  round technical interview my first technical interview for st profile consisted of two dsa questions few questions about the things on my resume and simple dbms question  people shortlisted for apps profile shortlisted for st profile and on waitlist for the apps profile  the same test given for both profiles  managing time is really important and taking small breaks in between subsections is totally okay  the test is proctored so even if you somehow time to copy answers from somewhere caught fairly easily  every section further divided into subsections and each subsection its own time limit  all the questions mcq based and there no negative marking  we did not have to write single line of code for the test  the questions mainly based on english aptitude computer science knowledge and understanding code  round online test the online test for oracle unlike any other online test that encountered during the internship season  got in through the server technology profile so ll explain that procedure here  both profiles have similar selection procedures an online test followed by interviews oracle comes for different profiles application development apps and server technology st  second round technical round major focus on dsa and core subjects os dbms oops and project third round technical round major focus on dsa and core subjects os dbms oops and project fourth round hr discussion about projects  just to as many as possible first round online test consists of mcq from coding skills verbal ability core cs subjects  the result declared by eod  then at the end he me if any questions for him  then he me an os question related to process synchronization  he me to write sql query to find the third max salary of an employee use self joins  then he moved on to dbms  count the number of ways to reach the nth step if you can take upto k steps at time  the questions he me standard  he me questions for which to explain my approach and code up on code pair  then he moved on to dsa questions  after that he me few basic questions about the projects in my resume  the interview with my introduction  round the second round one hour technical interview  first question variation of knapsack problem and the second one given two strings x and y find the longest subsequence of x which is also substring of y  round coding round there coding questions that to in one hour  the shortlist released later that night and here am writing this gyan review !the selection process consisted of rounds  towards the end he wanted an eli explain me like am esque description of one of my projects and impressed by the time  he anything and everything non technical about me my interest strengths weaknesses geeky stuff like comic books and also the new spiderman trailer lmao  my interviewer the technical director at one of the main teams at oracle and my god he cool guy  round hr this probably the most chill interview have ever  the interview ended with detailed overview of how life is at oracle and what would doing as an intern  this followed by rigorous cross questioning of everything talked about during my code walkthrough  the interviewer me to show the code and my commits in one of the projects so do make sure you actually put projects where you can show your contribution  to explain everything on my resume the why and the what  round techincal interview this round all about my resume  the interview ended with some random chit chat and through  to compile the code with proper input this is something you will pick up during your course labs  this involved making classes with proper names and using all the oops fundas wherever needed in addition to being able to explain them the interviewer will give you hints to do so and will counter question every line you write so make sure you know what you doing  to code common graph algos dijsktra and prims however to make sure to follow all the oops principle  round technical interview the interviewer really really chill  around people shortlisted for the interviews  time management and good grasp of the fundamentals is the key to getting through  the test is heavily proctored so keep your shenanigans to yourself  each of the sections and the corresponding subsections timed which made the test stressful especially if you attempting the test right after being rejected in an interview p  round online test this an online test with surprisingly only mcqs in topics ranging from dsa mostly trees os dbms aptitude logical reasoning and english communication  both profiles the same selection procedure an online test followed by minimum of three rounds of interview oracle india came on campus for two different profiles application development and server technology  overall both the interviews went very smoothly and the only one shortlisted  in the end he me my technological interest and the interview finished with discussion on cloud computing  answered mostly all questions correctly and clearly stated which topics didn have adequate knowledge on file systems  as well as resume questions  the last round minute technical round in which questions from mostly all cse domains dbms dsa os file systems oops  three students shortlisted after this round  in the end came to solution on which he agreed on  very interactive interview in which shared multiple solutions and my interviewer counter points  first round minute business round in which my interviewer me situation and me how to resolve  next day interviews scheduled  five students shortlisted and we one day seminar program in which they told us about upcoming projects which mostly involved ml and cloud computing  first round approximately minutes and the second round minutes  got dp leetcode medium question and string manipulation question  the second round aptitude questions as well as coding questions  the first one consisted of basic aptitude and situational based questions the selection procedure consisted of total rounds  he quite happy with that answer  used map told him that could optimize with moore voting algorithm  print the max number s appearing in list of numbers  ran all the test cases  to code the full program  if u unaware of some problem statement what do u do in that case ? what your dream companies ? he me one easy dsa question  they me hr questions like why visa ? what difficulties did u face while doing your project and how u solved that problem  round the interviewer really good  people who solved in minutes selected and people shortlisted  st round there two coding questions greedy dp many people solved both the questions so they made time of submission as their criteria for the selection there two rounds coding round and technical hr round  the list of selected candidates came at around pm the same day and selected  went for an hour  he took around mins to answer the questions and the interview over  him what work would do if get selected and if the company has any project going on related to blockchain  never ever say no to this in an interview  he then me if any questions for him  after the dsa questions he me few sql queries to write easy enough for anyone familiar with dbms  able to the first question while just the brute force approach for the second one  the other one combination of two questions print all possible words from phone digits and word break gfg  one of them question named edit distance you ll find on leetcode gfg  he then me two dsa questions medium to hard level  for me web application that already hosted so walkthrough of the whole website  after that he me to choose and explain one of my projects to choose the most complex one and explain every functionality about  the interview with brief intro  round technical hr round unlike other companies visa just one interview round where tried to cover almost everything under the table  both of them doable so speed the key here only those candidates who completed the test in around min shortlisted round coding round the test conducted on hackerrank and consisted of easy to medium level questions to solved within an hour  after this round people selected  the interviewer really friendly and helpful  then he me about my hobbies and finally why visa ? ?  technical hr round interview the interviewer me two simple dsa questions along with brief report about one of my projects  speed of the essence as only people who solved both questions within mins of the alloted hour selected  coding round questions in this round easy medium they shortlisted around people the process consisted of two rounds  finally interview round consisted of questions mainly based on your resume  my topic strategy or execution  in group discussion topics given to group of students and to discuss the same  the technical test for minutes test of aptitude verbal and core technical questions covered from your year portions the selection procedure rounds technical and aptitude test group discussion and interviews  the hr questions mostly based on why want to work in visa and what kind of career would looking to make in visa  and the rest of the questions based on the projects that  the technical questions that been one coding question for which brute force solution and since they did not me to improve didn do  after this people got selected for the internship  difficulty depends on your preparation  time around an hour  type of questions hr technical  then there will one interview round  after this they shortlisted around candidates  type of questions programming cp questions  difficulty easy medium  number of questions b  the first coding round  second round technical hr interview usually lasts from min to mins depending upon your performance and interest of the interviewer  first round online assessment two coding questions easy level  s internship recruitment process is divided into rounds  they also hr questions like why do you want to join visa which tech stack would you like to work on when you join visa  to explain each project in my resume  round technical cum hr interview the interviewer few dsa questions from topics like dp and hashing  only those who solved both questions within minutes shortlisted for the next round round online coding round on hackerrank platform the test consisted of easy medium questions which to solved in hour  the phone call to us about our interview experience and our location preference if we get selected  the technical interview focused on questions related to os and c programming  the online test pretty easy there questions on aptitude basic c programming and os concepts  finally in the hr call the hr me about the technical interview followed by my location preferences if any this question me hint about my selection the selection procedure consisted of an online test technical interview and phone call from hr  no dbms or coa question  the rest of the time the interviewer me questions on operating system semaphore and mutex context switching c programming especially memory allocations pointers memory leaks  in the technical interview which is of minutes to introduce myself later the interviewer some questions based on the resume for minutes  online test consists of aptitude basic coding and data structures there an online test technical interview and an hr interview call  make sure you ready with some questions to them  the hr will call to discuss about your interview your expectations with the internship and other queries  rd round hr interview once you clear the technical interview you will eligible for the hr interview  the interviewer will actually help you and make you feel comfortable  the interviewers focus on the approach rather than actual answer so make sure you express your ideas without any hesitation and tension of being judged  for interview thorough with the basics along with an idea of advanced applications  other than that questions based on basic of digital as per your strength and interest  prepared with all the shortcomings of your projects and go through them properly  questions included project description counter questions on them  round technical interview round about technical interview  coding part also included few theory questions on operating system along with c debugging focus on pointers and operator precedence category  included combinational and sequential circuit especially counter and register based questions  digital questions include the basic stuff almost every company asks along with few vhdl questions  questions divided equally into parts aptitude digital coding debugging based having questions each  st round online mcq based test without any negative marking  next we hr round in phone call  some other areas context switching threads some basic programs like swap and string concatenation in c language  also about memory leaks and detecting memory leaks in program  like when to use mutex and semaphores they showed me program and where to use semaphores in that  since the company works more on embedded systems they questions on operating systems concepts  round technical one  st round basic aptitude questions with some dbms os c c questions  keep questions in mind to and if you can relate with the interviewer s work background ll great  never say no to this question  after every round interviewer me if want to any questions  every round f f and hour long  there continuous typical hr questions like what projects you like team or individual ? what will you do if you want to convince your team for some feature ? what will you do if your idea is contradicting your team member s idea ? tell me situation when you faced x difficulty in your project ? tell me about the hackathon  he me whether want to do any higher education in the future  so knowing well about your resume is must  there lot of why this and why that in this round  he about my favorite project and why is my favorite ? then he went thru my resume and questions related to  the further questions completely based on my answer  prepare well for the typical hr question tell me about yourself  hr round this round began with my introduction  the interviewer satisfied at the end  as everything in my resume my own able to answer every question  this round more based on my resume than any dsa related stuff  then he questions related to the coursework in my resume  he about the hackathon in my resume  projects in my resume and he me in detail about every project  he about my previous internship experience and ic work  then he went through my resume and every possible question about  he some questions based on cs fundamentals  then he about the questions in the previous round  technical round the interviewer began with my introduction and my interests  he me the complexities of brute force as well as optimal solutions  after that wrote the pseudo code for the optimized solution  explained my approaches using test case and an online whiteboard  told him about different approaches to that  then he me medium hard dp question  technical round the interviewer me some basic cs questions in the beginning  around students shortlisted for the next round  mcqs related to different cs fundamentals like os dbms oops big o notation  the coding question of medium level  online assessment is comprised of sections coding question around mcqs there rounds in total oa tech hr  they continuously hr questions throughout both the interviews so they didn them separately in different round as such  not much about os and dbms in this round  further they me fundamental questions like explain how hashmap works and why segmentation fault occurs in c c  interview round in this they first me to explain my logic behind the snakes and ladder question in the written round make sure after every written round you and all the questions on your own org find minimum element in sorted and rotated array  after this they moved on to an easy dsa question to coded from scratch https www  interview round doing projects as part of my course so the first thing they me about my projects in further rounds not about them  after the written round people shortlisted for interviews  section subjective questions on team work  section cs theory and fundamentals very important for interviews also as they really test your basics  section aptitude and maths org snake ladder problem  section medium hard coding question on graphs https www  section easy coding questions only speed required here as questions to solved in min  st round written round that divided into sections with individual time limits  the interview ended with couple of questions related to c  then to implement vector class in c using arrays  initially to explain one of my project and which the most difficult part  this combination of hr technical interview  round after about mins got call for this interview  this interview ended with some discussion about the company  this followed by puzzle  this also leetcode medium problem  after this he one dsa question which application of two pointers and binary search  the round begin with discussion about my projects and he how could add feature and also discussed one optimization  round after about mins got call for round  in the end couple of os questions  both the questions leetcode medium problems  after this the interviewer two dsa questions one related to anagrams and the other about graphs  round the round with brief introduction about myself followed by discussion about my projects  about people shortlisted for interviews  sections and time limit on each section initially there normal screening test  my solution using map at last he me if select you which role would you like to work for ? told my answer and the interviewer very happy you can remove any character and check whether the first condition holds or not all character s frequency must the same  then he me one question which is given string tell if the string is valid or not  then he me whether string is immutable or not ? no  the fourth round hr round zoom platform min the interview with introductions and then he asking questions on java like what is map how the map will work and he whether we can change the key in the map ? no since the key is immutable  and able to explain him clearly e without using any technical words  at last he went through my resume and me to explain one of the projects in simple words  my solution using backtracking  leaf is node with no children  root to leaf path is path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node  each path should returned as list of the node values not node references  the second question given the root of binary tree and an integer targetsum return all root to leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals targetsum  my solution using map the code did not give the correct output but the approach correct  but he modified the question little bit and told me to return all indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target  you can return the answer in any order  you may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice  the first question given an array of integers nums and an integer target return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target  at last he me some questions on oops like what is oop ? what the oops concepts ? what is encapsulation ? and what is an abstract class ? third round technical round zoom platform min the interview with introductions and he me two questions share your screen and code  he modified the question and me if the target element is not present then return the position where he can insert the target element and if the target element is present then you have to return the position using linear search only  my solution linear search  he told me to do in simple way without consideration of performance  then for the previously sorted array he me one target element he me to return the index of the target element  he told me to share my screen and write pseudo code for the same in any editor  my solution merge sort because in the best average and worst case its time complexity is an order of nlogn  second round technical round zoom platform min the interview with introductions and then he has given me an array which is unsorted and he told me to sort the array in increasing order mcqs based on operating systems dbms networking time complexity web development and some output questions  the coding question to find the maximum product of two non overlapping palindromic subsequences first round coding and mcq round held on the hackerrank platform  in the end them about the company s work culture employee growth  wasn able to answer all of them correctly but they seemed satisfied with my performance  some questions why mongodb ? why not sql ? difference between react functional components and class components and some more questions related to react js  afterward they asking questions from theoretical subjects os dbms oop explanation of my project and then some questions regarding the tech stack used in the project  then he me to code not the complete code just the helper functions  then he if know about lru cache and which data structures will used to  the interviewers friendly and helpful  solved all but required hint for the last variation  the hardness level kept increasing with each variation  some of them solved using the greedy approach while others using dynamic programming  then he kept on modifying the question and me modifications and me how will them  they me if remember the hard question in the coding round after that he explained that question again in brief and how solved that  rd round also an online technical interview that lasted hour  they also about my project and after that they if have any questions for them  after that they asking me oop os and dbms based questions  to code both of them and he ran them against sample test cases  there interviewers and after the introduction they me array based dsa questions easy medium level  round an online technical interview that lasted minutes  the easy question from arrays medium questions from the graph and the last marks from graph dp  the total marks of easy marks medium marks each hard marks  st round coding round which consisted of questions of varying difficulties then the interviewer me to code an implementation based question in minutes  round technical interview in which again theory questions for about minutes followed by detailed discussion on data structures like heaps and tries an informal approach to make google recommendations  round technical interview in which theory oops os dbms for minutes followed by an easy dp questions minimum coins to make an amount which to code in minutes  round hr just simple discussion about my interests and he me why did want to join arcesiumonline coding test two easy medium questions one an implementation based and the other bit manipulation on the codility platform in which the test cases hidden  after that some generic os questions  they me to design banking system using objects and classes  rd round this round pure oops and os based  round again they me more dsa questions which bit tougher than the question in the previous ones  st round they dsa questions and me to optimize so that has minimum space and time complexity coding round some aptitude questions some oops java based which could not do and coding questions  finally students selected for the internship  this pretty chill round and the questions just to know and understand more about me  round the last round hr  questions on paging and normalization and then grilled for while on my resume  round the third round only based on os dbms concepts and my resume  after the interviewer me if any questions for him and we short discussion before ending the round  my task to find the maximum path sum in binary tree  round the second interview round purely dsa based  finally the interviewer me if any questions for her and then concluded the round  after this few questions on hashing and how to prevent hash collisions  in the first round few questions on oops mainly based on the virtual keyword followed by simple dsa question best time to buy and sell stocks ii on leetcode  round all the technical interview rounds conducted on hackerrank s codepair platform  the coding questions of medium level one dp and students shortlisted for the next round  round the first round an online test containing mcqs on aptitude cs concepts and coding questions the selection procedure involved rounds in total online test and interviews  also some basic power electronics questions  round interview they by asking me to explain the projects on my cv and some technical questions based on that  round gd the topic the impact of automation on jobs and given on the spot  st round written test aptitude questions domain questions eee for me fairly easy round gd fairly generic topic impact of automation on jobs rd round interview few technical questions along with discussion of cv projectsround written test consisted of aptitude verbal and technical eee for me sections  the third round mainly dbms round where queries needed to written acc to what the interviewer wants in the database then followed by basic oops theory and an intermediate dsa question  first round basic dsa questions and oops theory second round more on resume and questions on my resume followed by dsa question  after getting shortlisted in the written round there round of interviews eliminative in nature  st round wriiten round of questions ranging from aptitude to dsa and cs theory  he finally tricky logical puzzle and observed how approached the question  he off the questioning by asking about my projects and branched off to few technical questions which related to my projects in my case digital electronics and signal processing  the interviewer mainly wanted to know how well knew my work  for me the interview mostly based on my resume where in depth questions about my projects  technical interview the platform ms teams and went on for about minutes  overall level of the paper would between moderate and difficult would say and there negative marking for wrong answers  the last section the technical section where candidates choice between digital communications and software chose digital  the first section aptitude followed by the programming section  online test there sections each of questions  then followed the selection elimination procedure of rounds the procedure with small online pre recruitment talk  talked for mins straight measuring evwery line said because rejected on hr in previous interview and that is heart breaking  then came the hr question tell me about your in domain and general interests when comes to working in corporate team as memebr fo the team and as leader of team  you have liberty to rmeove character from any index myself told all edge cases and different ways string may valid and went on to write the pseudo code  all characters should repeat same number of times  the heirarchy of conditions that make string valid  given string tell if the string is valid or not  the next qs also on maps  the hint what is difference between strign in java and cpp simple to catch  the question boiled down to is ok to change the keys in hashmap ? no why do you think so ? immutability is key s requirement because of the way hashing works did need hint to arrive at this answer  so he combined the concepts  pretty intense also given that this hr round you dont want to mess up your tone and language he noticed that not anything on hashing oop so far  but knew the project inside out so able to justify everything said  he made quick conclusions and cross questioned everything said  he went through my resume and me to describe my web development project in my projects section  the interview with introductions and the interviewer the hiring manager  hr round this round another f f interview round  this entire round about proper coding and compiling the code required  write the pseudo code to determine exactly which ball the heavier one in least usage of the weighing balance  am also given weighing balance with scales  given balls we know that exactly ball is heavier than others  then we came down to more sql queries using offset and limit again finally there riddle for me  then he followups on the same qs what is the difference if the list is sorted and how do detect and remove cycle in the list  to justify every statement made  in this question he did not want the algorithm but wanted the critical time complexities to the question with and without an external ds  given linked list with duplicates remove the duplicates  basic variation of the known problem  went on to brag about my web development manager role at iris nitk given binary tree and the requirement function that printed the cousin nodes of all nodes in the tree  he went through my resume and me to describe any of the entries in my experience section  the interview with introductions and the interviewer team lead for manging services  technical round this round another f f interview round  some faking never hurts this entire round only pseudo code and no compiling  catch you cant use division operator  have to return the product of all numbers in the array except the element at the index  finally the last question that am given an array and an index  that took me while to arrive at  him o n algorithm by deriving critical relations between b interms of c but he looking for method that used prime factorization  obviously everyone knows this but faking during the interview doesn hurt given number n find all triplets b c such that the following conditions hold b c and b c  find the number of ways to reach the nth step  you can jump either or steps at time  easy ! you have staircase with n stairs  do so in less than traversals of the list  given linked list find the sum of last n nodes of the list without the use of any external ds  give the differences between set and list  they very straight forward like find the student with fourth highest marks in the class given schema for the same  two sql queries for that used offset limit and nested queries  the interview with introductions and the interviewer math phd so knew what coming my way ! he went through my resume and discussed my domain knowledge and my favourite subjects  technical round this round f f interview round  mcqs these based on time complexity analysis dbms simple data structures networking os web development some output questions and well known algorithms  we to return that score  the variation that the input string assigned score which defined as the maximum product of the lengths of non overlapping pallindromic subsequences of the string  coding question simple variation of the count all pllindromic subsequences in given string  online test this round coding mcq round  later in the evening got phone call from the hr we discussed about my interests and location preferences  then we discussed about my interests and projects and what kind of work profile looking for  since am from ece branch the interviewer also me about some basic digital communication qpsk to specific  after that given aptitude kind of questions  also questions based on bit masking  questions based on basic data structures like linked list graphs and trees  round online interview my interview about mins long  comprised of questions related to data structures find the output and os related question  went for the software section  for the third section we given choice to select between hardware and software  few questions on c also askedselection procedure mainly consisted of rounds round online screening test the test consisted of sections first two sections compulsory and based on basic programming and aptitude  static linking vs dynamic linking how dynamic linking is advantageous for system that keeps updating regulary  questions on oops mainly virtual tables and virtual functions  another question where to design stack which gives the minimum element present inside the stack in o space and time all the elements that would pushed to the stack is in the range some os theory questions on deadlocks segmentation paging is segmentation related to segmentation fault xd and how segmentation fault occurs  round with question which on gcds to count number of different possible gcds we can form considering all the subsequences of the given array  solution based on hashes where we convert the string into an integer also discussed about how we can avoid collisions and follow up question which remember exactly for which tries would perform better  this followed by dsa type question where to implement memory efficient dictionary should check if particular word string is present in the dictionary or not  questions on how memory is allocated on the stack and heap followed by question on how can we ensure that there s no memory that will allocated on the heap we have to overload operator new and throw link errors whenever s used  then there dsa question which variation of knapsack followed by sql query group by and having clause based also used join and hence about using natural join vs inner join if readability is our only concern  round with brief description about one of my projects and several relevant theory questions and questions on how some of the features implemented in c the interviewer me about the syntax as well  there weren many questions on my resume  each round with dsa question for which your solution will run against preloaded test cases few sql queries which again would run on some test cases not all of them questions on oops os and some dbms theory  this followed by rounds of technical interviews both the rounds the exact same format and held on codepair  the third and final round technical interview where they about my projects some fundementals related to my projectsfirst round an online coding round there dsa questions easy medium hard each question s own allotted time in the sense that you could not conserve time by solving question quickly  my topic about nep national education policy  st round an online test which english based aptitude logical and technical questions  typical questions like why might want to join qualcomm preference of job location job specific preferences  the final round hr interview that conducted over phone  finally there some general questions and we concluded the interview with one or two basic questions on logic gates  also to describe my previous experience even though wasn very related to the hardware profile  to show my work and the interviewer me some specific questions about the project and why chosen particular way to do  in my case most of the discussion confined to the projects that in my resume  the second round technical interview which conducted on ms teams  the questions mostly of easy to moderate difficulty  there also few questions on dacs and adcs  finally the hardware section questions on basic digital electronics including combinational circuits flip flops counters and logic families  found the questions to of moderate difficulty  the programming section objective questions from basic c programming and data structures including linked lists and stacks prefix to infix conversion  found the aptitude section on the tougher side  aptitude some passage based questions and other general topics like mixtures shares  each section questions and the total duration two hours  the test conducted on hirepro platform and audio and video proctored  first round written test which three sections aptitude basic programming and third section where we to select one out of hardware software and communications the overall procedure three rounds written test technical interview and hr interview  apart from this simple technical questions  while explaining my project work they interrupted couple of times to related question  only about my projects  two technical interviews while some of the others only one  rd round technical interview  wasn as dominating as some of the other members in the group but made sure brought unique perspective into the discussion without repeating myself or anyone else  the topic given to our group start up india boosting the economy  st round online test mcqs with sections verbal aptitude logical reasoning and technical  finally hr informed us through phone call  detailed explanation about my projects expected second round consisted of interview for one hour questions about my interests operating systems some programming questions and puzzle aptitude basic c programming output questions pointers os and some coa questions  group discussion is the time of ic engines over ? interview they me about the projects on my resume and questions based on those concepts technical test vocab reasoning quant and technical questions  post which how vectors and hash maps work in c c  the interviewer me about the project like the most why like and what interesting in  the fourth and final round short one about minutes  ended the interview with coding question parenthesization of the given equation  later minmax game theory question explained how would approach the problem  after which grilled on my resume for about minutes  went with the trie approach and supposed to explain how would build the said trie and how would then do the string search  the third round with ds question where to implement dictionary to find all the strings which match the given prefix  the interviewer satisfied with the way answered them  in between also to build an os for certain use case he just wanted to see how approached the problem and what would taking under consideration  after which questions on various os concepts think he covered almost all of the concepts which part of the course  explained the approach first and analysed the time and space complexity to type the code out and execute for the output  the second round with the standard open the lock problem leetcode  the interviewer satisfied with all of my answers  for each of the questions explained my approach along with the time and space complexity  to code the graph question out  first round dsa questions in total dp graph line sweep greedy math based the test consisted of sections each section time bound coding easy medium quantitative aptitude coding moderate hard computer programming mcq s os dsa dbms hr questions rounds of interview  in both the rounds they also me to explain about my projects from my resume and the tech stacks  in the second round they me an easy question which solved using maps and another question based on strings and trie  they me to optimize further and some conceptual questions related to maps  in the first round they me an easy question which solved using maps  after the online test there interview rounds which could vary between  each section time bound but you could switch between the sections  there sections coding basic programming questions aptitude questions based on maths and quantitative aptitude mcqs based on cs advanced programming medium hard dsa question and subjective short essay questions the first round consisted of an online test on hackerrank platform for around hours minutes  last question based on binary search but with some modification  based on they me about structure of data storage and how can optimized further ? thereafter again simple trees question in which task to output all the elements nodes visible from the right view of tree  they me to explain about any one of my projects  interview round in this round interviewer focused on my resume and projects  there few hr questions too in this round  further also oops questions  to code my solution and improve further  task to check if value of node equals the sum of all nodes in the subtree rooted at  interview round one problem solving question based on binary trees  also to code my solution and run  interview round only one question in which given n matrix and number k task to find the number of paths from top left cell to bottom right cell such that sum of all elements in path equals k  coding questions decent to  since mcqs negative marking one must careful while marking answers coding test test total sections as follows coding cs mcq problem solving mcq advanced problem solving and subjective  the results declared in about hours after the last of the interviews ended  they selected interns this year  hr questions like why did you consider applying for nvidia do you have any plans for higher studies  only one question from my resume and to describe one of my projects  one question based on fsm and counters from the online test discussed  also two basic c questions on switch case and operators  basic questions starting from universal gates buffer mux gates from mux flip flops  interview this technical cum mini hr round  candidates selected for the interview round  all the questions objective fill the blanks type and partial marking awarded with questions having more than one answers  proctored test and consisted questions based on digital electronics static timing analysis sta basic c programming memory and aptitude  online test conducted on hakerrank platform  there only rounds for nvidia  last year to this year due to covid  cgpa cut off this year reduced from nvidia didn conduct any pre rec talk  the second round interview based on the above topics  st round questions in fill in the blanks format of questions from digital electronics memories aptitude and c programming  after around hours the results announced  in this interview there discussion on the project that on my resume  in round which the third interview the interviewer began asking few questions based on dbms and again some puzzles and probability questions  this round also followed by questions based on project on the resume few puzzles and probability questions  after an hour my third round where they simple dsa problem that to explain and then code  in round just puzzle and probability based question  guess on an average everyone interview rounds  around people shortlisted in the first round to proceed to the next round of interviews  this test around sections out of which coding problems mcqs on mathematics aptitude and other cs related topics  unlike the tests of other companies the one of goldman sachs around hours min long the first round an online coding test on hackerrank  some questions regarding oops  questions on sql queries  then question on weighted directed graphs  rd round first we some discussion about goldman sachs activities its pros and cons small debate  and we nice chat about the company  round medium level question on hash maps  simple mathematical puzzle based on probability  delete node in ll pointer to head is not given expected o tc  question on rotated array standard interview bit problem  interviews st round first project based perfect with your project  advanced cp question based on graphs suggest you to prepare more on this graphs some hr related stuff  mcqs based on dsa os  st coding round prelims there some sections easy cp advanced cp mcqs hr related first cp questions easy  some general questions on second law  tech questions based on my resume  some people weren even hr questions  some people hr round separately  for me only interview where they some hr questions in the last mins  lasted for about mins although reviewers can cut in at anytime to stop the gd  minutes given to us to search up few points  people in each panel and topic for me start up india boosting entrepreneurship  around students selected for round  there also theory questions on automobiles  technical based on thermo fluids manufacturing your basic second year courses  apti and verbal really easy  all mcq based on aptitude verbal and technical divided into different sections  questions about my projects and my knowledge and experience in programming languages and software that know askedround written test  the rd round personal interview  my topic should money spent on sportspersons for the olympics or should spent for socio economic problems ?  the round group discussion round  the technical section covered wide range of topics from the first two years syllabus the st round an online test of sections verbal ability logical reasoning quantitative reasoning and technical  then few questions related to computer architecture and os  this followed by discussion about my projects  the interviewer wanted the approach to the question and every time correct approach he would raise the difficulty little bit more by adding some variations to the question  in this round hard level dsa question given  the second round about minutes long  then question based on dsa given and to code out  questions related to dbms oops and os first  the first round went for about minutes  this followed by technical rounds  there questions of varying difficulties easy marks medium marks medium marks hard marks summing up to maximum of marks the first round an online coding round held on hackerearth platform  then to do in constant space and write test cases would test with  came up with bfs solution  to fill the left and right siblings for each nodes com problems populating next right pointers in each node ii  in the end given dsa problem similar to https leetcode  in oop polymorphism and its types static and runtime  the question on parallel processing dropped as told didn know assembly  os threads and advantage of using multiple processors instead of single big processors  dbms indexing and why we index the whole table and make all queries faster  project that used google oauth and to explain the oauth workflow with follow up questions like why wasn secure to use client secret on mobile apps and to give alternatives to make secure  third round around hour  in the few mins left some hr ? questions like what my passion motivation and hobbies  to also explain the time and space complexity of the solution com problems binary tree maximum path sum  dsa question based on trees similar to https leetcode  easy medium second min interview  process shared memory and ipc system calls fork call zombie and orphan processesfirst an online coding test with two questions  dsa questions we needed to get the sum of nodes in the components and then use those components as input for standard knapsack problem round toposort dfs but children nodes assigned priority order in which they must visited round some weirdly worded question which boiled down to find gcd of an array of numbers something similar came for uber as well round the an algo that traversed tree in weird way and we to reconstruct the tree from the output of the given algo round leetcode jump game ii round some very basic array question something like find product of nonzero elements in array remember really round os questions threads v  almost everyone passes this round round technical round this round they question your resume projects and academic subjects like os oops toc compilers if you aren confident with particular subject just tell them upfront and they ll scrap all questions from that subject  r online assessment questions marks slight modifications of those available in company archives google leetcode codeforces online assement these aticles slightly more recent than gfg round the screening round no major questions here just talk about your resume your interests even the coding question very simple basic array question  third round with discussion on my projects then he few hr questions and later dsa question on linked list  questions based on queue bfs two pointers  given dsa question in each of the first two rounds and to code on codility platform  first two rounds technical rounds while third round hr technical  students shortlisted for interviews online round easy questions  also while coding the two solutions he questions from oop and c  the interviewer kept altering each of the two problems slightly  given two coding questions  the third round the deciding round  the interviewers gradually increased the complexity of the problem as solved the simpler one  in the second round of the interview there one binary tree problem  the interviewer very friendly discussing my interests and the field that want to work in and also his field of work in microsoft  interviews in the first round of interviews there one easy matrix problem coding test there easy coding problems with little bit of logic and very short code  couple of behavioural questions followed by few questions about the projects on my resume  he did help me and then able to the question  didn have any knowledge about system design so have for help  the interviewer me system design question  the last interview hr  to use meaningful variable and function names  in the end coding the optimal solution  more of discussion rather than questionnaire  there multiple ways in which we can design this leaderboard so we discussing the tradeoffs in each approach  clarifying questions to understand the problem statement  the second interview min coding round and to design leaderboard for game  if time permits to explain the time complexity and space complexity of your approach  an easy question but its important to think out loud and clarifying questions  the first technical interview min problem solving interview where to tell my approach to particular problem and why works and then code  two of three questions from dynamic programming  online assessment coding questions which of medium hard difficulty  online assessment technical interviews hr interview  total of candidates selected by microsoft for this internship opprotunity  got notification in the evening with the final list and happy to see my name on  he then me if any questions for him and then the interview ended at am  again wasn able to complete the code because of lack of time but we healthy discussion about this last problem  to analyze couple of test cases which may fail in the most basic idea that you get but able to give him an efficient solution for by the end of the interview  basically given two tapes and write into by looking ahead in the tapes to find the carry  you can only read ahead on the tapes and cannot look back like linked list with single pointer  given two magnetic tapes containing terabytes of data write the sum of the two tapes on to another tape but the carry operation works in the opposite direction  next he me really simple question  he also me to write couple of sql queries on any type of join that wanted  he me question about the different types of joins in dbms and explained them with the help of venn diagrams  this went on for about minutes and then he seemed satisified  he said that he wasn aware of the internal workings of qr code and wanted me to explain about  he me to explain about any one of my projects and explained about qr code project that made  he seemed very friendly but throughout the interview he the one who the most interactive and involved in the process  round project discussion ds computer science fundamentals the final interview began at am and this time the interviewer me to introduce myself and why chose this particular line of study  received the notification for the next interview at am and the final round scheduled for am  able to code about of the solution but we ran out of time and the interview ended at about am  him an approach along these lines and he seemed happy about but kept asking me for proof of concept for few statements made  although this approach would work the interviewer hinted for me to go in different direction and after few minutes of discussion understood that he wanted me to merge all the calendars together into one list and to use that to get the answer  already preconceived idea of how to this problem and what basically wanted to do have record of the possible times when the meeting could scheduled for the first people and then update this record by intersecting the next person s calendar with the current record  he shared codility link like the previous interview and me the following problem given calendar of n people find the next free slot of minutes for them all  round ds coding round this interview at am and the interviewer once again did not for my introduction and got straight to the questions  the interview ended at about am and got notification at am for the next round which scheduled for am  him couple of approaches but couldn code them due to the time constraint  bunch of questions and understood what he really wanted after few minutes  very vague question and unable to clearly decipher the exact meaning of the question  basically given generic tree and an array of nodes of said tree we to modify the generic tree so that only contained the nodes that in the array  my second question little tougher org boundary traversal of binary tree able to explain my thought process and coded out the solution for him without any major hiccups  s standard binary tree problem https www  my first question to print the boundary of binary tree  the interviewer got straight to the point and me question on an online collaborative editor codility  the interview at am dot  round ds coding round appeared for microsoft interviews in the morning  microsoft shortlisted candidates for the next rounds of interviews  the second question bit manipulation type problem remember the details but wasn too difficult  the first question math question given number find the next smallest number that has no two consecutive same digits  we given minutes to code up the solutions to these questions  round online assessment on codility of cp questions of easy medium difficulty for the microsoft selection process to go through rounds of assessment in total  straight forward questions in os semaphores mutexes dbms indexing joins oops virtual functions v tables v pointers  round technical min some project discussion medium question on trees but then the interviewer made harder by adding some constraints also to write test cases for the question  round technical min detailed project discussion for about min one classical dp problem and question on binary trees  round technical min some open ended questions on sorting huge amounts of data and some straight forward questions on strings and matrices online coding assessment medium questions on codility platform our code scored against hidden test cases so testing the code with edge cases is important  the entire interview over at  did not have to code up and just tell him the design and how and why will work  weighted graph approach and the complexity of terrible  dots and boxes game  what data structures would use and why  in the last minutes he me game and me how would design  he very patient throughout the entire interview  he me about my teamwork strength weaknesses and failures and what learned from them  he me about my projects in my resume and discussed one of them in detail  my third round at  got call for the next round in minutes  he me if any questions for him and he answered patiently  the problem to code and discuss and explain took good minutes and then we made dry run  kept on discussing my ideas along with implementing them and asking him what the function should do in case of edge cases  in this they wanted clean working code with proper names and structure  coding round of minutes in which told to design the leaderboard of game with functionalities like add delete user insert update score get all users with score x top people  the second round at  got call for the second round in the next minutes  the first round over and he me if any questions from him  but failed on couple of main tests afterward  he told me to code up and ran for some sample test cases  he said to improve further and shared an o n time and o space solution  he told me to improve so an o n time and space complexity with two pointers  first binary search approach with prefix sum and time complexity o n logn and space o n  given string of s and b s and an integer k you can flip maximum k characters find the maximum length of substring with all equal characters  the first round problem solving round of minutes in which given medium level problem to  my interview at in the morning  after this round ten people shortlisted for interviews  the last problem spinoff version of knapsack  the second problem more complex with topics bitset prime factorization and dp  the first problem to convert base number to base  there three problems with scores the first round an online coding round held on codesignal  in all of these interviews expected to code them in any language and run for test case  the rd round consisted of few behavioural questions few on my past experiences projects and question on reversing specific nodes of linked list  in the round required to find min slot when every participant is free given set of intervals for each participant com is called times then the answer should google com is called times and yahoo  in the first round to find the number of times sub domain is called for given set of domains and their respective counts eg  there total of interviews elimination based the first two being technical and the last one being hr technical  total of students shortlisted for the next set of interviews the initial screening round consisted of solving coding questions in mins one involved bit manipulation and the other one to find the first integer greater than n not having same consecutive digits  but before reached stages in the program where think he would have chipped in and told me the initial algo wrong noticed the mistakes myself and kept rectifying them  much unlike other interviews when initially proposed my algorithm which wrong he told me to start coding in and allowed me to debug and test as much as want  just really enjoying the question and trying to come to solution and think seeing me get to step by step boded well with the interviewer  however able to enter for lack of better term flow  then dsa question which bit more difficult  didn know this beforehand which told him but proposed two solutions that logically made sense to me  then some questions about the vector class itself and how works  technical interview initially questions about vectors and how they different from an array  this took me lot of time so wasn any other questions  that vital towards coding in the final solution  my interviewer plenty of questions about what would valid input when should returning an error and so on  technical interview dsa question that not very logically difficult but similar to the first coding test lot of test cases  technical interview question on trees proposed the solution that came to me intuitively and he happy to let me start coding in  so you have to and find the other hidden test cases on your own and make sure your code works for those before you submit  you could only submit the code once and would only run for example test cases online coding test logically not that hard but required cool and calm mind as there lot of testcases to cover  he me to code the most optimized solution and he ran against few test cases  later on he me simple linked list question that involved finding the middle and reversing variation of an already popular question  for the last interview he began by asking lot of cliche hr questions  brute force solution and optimized the solution using doubly linked list and map  for the question he me only the approach for implementing lru cache  we discussed lot on this topic and went on for almost mins  he then me to implement card deck shuffling system using oops  he began by asking me about my background in eee and why software prepared for this xd  for the technical interview my interviewer super friendly  in the last few minutes he me to explain one of the projects  better solution and he me to code and he ran against few sample test cases  brute force solution and he me to optimize  in the first technical interview he me question that closely related to merging intervals  further total of technical interviews the last one being technical hr round  hence you to analyze the corner cases yourself and write the most optimized code in terms of space and time complexity and make the submission  you allowed to make only one submission  held on platform called codility the first round consisted of easy questions which based on numbers and bit manipulation  we then talked little bit about linux and some microsoft products and then he me about scheduling question  dry running my approach and he me few questions about my code and then realized my mistake and corrected  after some time able to  then he me question on linked list  completed and he then me question on double pointer  then he me c style pointer function to complete  then interviewer and talked about covid how affected my college life how affected microsoft  the interviewer by introducing himself and his role in microsoft  the round after about hours from the previous one  rd round expecting an hr round but the interview mostly technical and little mix of hr  she expected me to write clean code for everything and use oops  we then discussed edge test cases and my code passed all test cases and the interview finished  then after the writing function she me to test by completing the whole code by adding graph class  she me to assume we given graph node and just write recursive function  so after for some time explained my approach and she me to code  she then me question on the graph  the recruiter me to share my screen this time  interview interview around min after finishing the first one  he also to dry run my approach for various edge test cases  he me the time and space complexity of each approach  he then me to optimize which did by two other methods by the trading memory  first explained my bf approach for the problem and he me to code  however then he ended up giving me question on linked lists  answered by saying bit manipulation dp  st round interview interviwerer by asking me about my fav topics in ds  solved both with one question at the last possible minute  oa round two easy medium questions given to solved in min on codility platform  third round hr technical with some questions from resume and the projects  second one coding round with more focus on code modularity good variable names  questions based on dp sliding window  first round problem solving round with dsa questions online round medium hard coding questions  moving on he me medium level dsa question which to implement in the codility platform  also to walk him through the code  in the interview first to show very detailed demo of the teams clone project based on my presentation the interviewer me questions about implementation and the chosen tech stack  to sit for direct on campus interview for microsoft through the engage program  along with your submissions the mentor s feedback also played vital role in the evaluation com engage once the microsoft mentorship and acehacker challenge got over the candidates who performed well getting their interview slots and some exceptional submissions even received direct internship offer at microsoft  learn more about the challenge https microsoft  the challenge for the engage program to build working clone of the microsoft teams app within month  once the results announced all the selected candidates assigned microsoft engineer mentor  having solid grasp on dsa and cs fundamentals is must to quality this round  comprised of mcqs coding questions where writing pseudo code expected with couple of essay based questions on technology and cs  the first round qualifying test which mainly tested your dsa and cs fundamentals  is program created by microsoft engineers in association with ace hacker for students to work on projects with live interaction and help from engineers and mentors at microsoft in early june microsoft opened applications for the engage program  following this several os related questions mainly from threading and he questions from my os project  him o n solution but the space complexity o n so he not satisfied and me to think of o space approach  the question medium level linked list question and could code in any language thankfully  he even executed the code in his compiler so make sure you put pseudo code  then two dsa questions one of easy difficulty but the interviewer me to code in c language as he wanted to test my pointers and memory allocation knowledge which made the question much harder  the interview with the interviewer asking lots of questions about my projects in my resume  now on to the oncampus interview  this year s project to build microsoft teams clone  after being selected for the program we to work on month long project  the selection for engage on the basis of resume screening and coding round  let me first describe how got in engage program and what did there as microsoft engage student s mentorship program by microsoft didn have to write the first coding round and there only single interview round for the engage students  third round given linkedlist problem where to find the pattern question and also code on codility and after that he me about my projects and questions about some of the features of projects and finally some hr questions  then explained the approach and also improved the code quality  also he told me to not use any global variable and make space efficient as much as possible  he focused more on the implementation part  after this problem based on trees where to find the minimum distance between two nodes and the interviewer told me to write the code completely and then explain him  the main thing in this problem to use counting sort to sort the strings instead of the inbuilt sort function cpp  the first problem to group anagrams  second round again two dsa problems in this round  able to come up with an optimal solution for both of them  the interviewer me to code tabulation dp instead of recursive memorization  the second problem buy and sell stocks ii  the input string and we needed to check if is valid according to the given constraints  the first problem basic implementation problem  first round problems and to code them on codility the online test easy problems  questioned lot in depth on os as an os project on my resume  third round mins based on os and oops concepts and coding only and no dsa  second round mins purely dsa one problem on binary trees and another one on classic dp  first round mins based on my projects concepts in os networking and one dsa problem on binary trees  followed by technical interviews but no hr round  consisted of problems of easy medium difficulty first round coding round held on codility platform  also questions based on my projects  the third round dsa resume based round where to code addition and multiplication for big integers  also questions about multi threading in the second round how web server can accept and process multiple http requests to precise  the second round also dsa round where question based on sliding window and hashmap concepts  fundamental dsa question based on binary trees in the first round  there three interview rounds  then after two days interviews held  results released the next day and got shortlisted for the interview round  rd round initially questioned on my resume later we moved to standard dsa question based on tries after that few hr questions and for the daythe first round minute coding round which consisted of easy level questions based on bit manipulation and math  round another dsa round my interviewer didn know c in detail so to explain lot later he os questions  st round the interviewer very friendly and given easy dsa question online test easy questions  finally there an hr round  in the second technical interview dsa problems dp dijkstra and puzzle  in the first technical interview questions based on tree stack queue and dp  this followed by rounds tech hr  there total of questions of varying difficulties medium medium hard which to solved in mins the first round an online coding round  also to implement heap sort  some time complexity questions and puzzle  find the number of paths in grid from cell to n with exactly k bends dp question  some questions given list of numbers concatenate them to form the largest number possible modified sorting  technical rounds based on dsa and questions on things listed on resume  there technical rounds of interview followed by hr round  only people shortlisted for interviews coding round consisted of medium and hard question  students finally selected after the interviews  medium hard questions on strings dp and geometry  this followed by eliminative interview rounds based on dsa  students shortlisted after the online assessment and resume screening  questions roughly sufficient to get shortlisted although not guaranteed  the questions medium hard based on dp trees and strings first round an online assessment round for mins of questions  the results of the interviews declared on the same day  both of them entirely on dsa  each interview lasted precisely minutes and they scheduled just minutes apart  after this two rounds of technical interviews on the same day sometimes you may have three if the interviewers need more clarity on your skills  they explained the whole selection procedure us an idea on the topics we could expect to tested on and clarified any doubts  before the interviews we prep session with recruiters from google  following this our resumes reviewed and candidates shortlisted for the interviews  there two cp style questions that we to in one hour we first an online coding round on hackerearth  the second interview ended at noon and gotten my result at around pm the same day  all the questions above purely dsa and coded them in c  again given two questions medium hard  minutes after my first interview ended my second and final interview  after clearing that my first round of interviews given two questions easy hard  think there is any strict cut off in the online test as there weightage to resume and other factors as well the first round an online coding test  students received an internship offer based on their performance during the hackathon  is hour hackathon where participants collaborate to develop innovative technology solutions for nonprofit organizations  the selected students then participated in the virtual code for good event students first shortlisted on the basis of an online coding test and hirevue video interview  the return offer for third year internship given based on the work during the step project and associated feedback  then got selection call from my recruiter about week later  typically they re scheduled on the same day with break in between but in my case them on two separate days in mid december  after this there two technical interviews that focus on dsa mins each  the application process for step began in late november and the candidates first filtered based on their resumes i received return offer after my second year step internship at google  this year all conducted online  after being shortlisted there many workshops held to help with the actual event hr hackathon where participants have to create solution for specific problem statements to help ngo s from all over the country  initial screening rounds involved submission of form with resume followed by online automated interviews and coding test  st round online aptitude test and basic mechanical questions round general hr related quiz rd round technical interview and hr interviewi got the internship via the code for good hackathon  my interviews on december and got the selection call week later  both my interviews on the same day with gap of nearly hour and each interview precisely minutes  since these interviews occur in year os and dbms not but knowing oops will help you write clean code for the coding questions  there typically two technical interviews some of my friends also interview rounds if google felt like rounds not enough to evaluate you purely dsa based coding rounds  after the resume screening round around students selected for the interviews from our college  the st round is resume screening  the applications for step rolled out during november end i received return offer after completing my step internship at google during the summer of  some general questions also pertaining to my view on life st round written test round personal interview round mostly like hr round with technical questions  questions based on the projects

gathering using technology how covid vaccines and oxygen cylinders should distributed  they didn any technical question  second round interview in which they focused more on our innovative ideas on real problems first round profile screening based on resume in which they shortlisted candidates from b tech  the interview is more focused on the resume  the questions mainly focused on my projects and some basics of the subjects  after that there round of interviews there an online exam that comprised mcqs and programming questions  after which the interview where they behavioral questions and also general technical questions  rounds based on projectsthe first round an online test for hrs having technical java and c based questions aptitude questions and also coding questions there  they

there an essay writing question to test your writing skills also  the first question based on trees and the second based on strings  normal english comprehension questions and analytics questions and at last two coding questions of easy to medium level difficulties  which consisted of aptitude questions  st round technical test  the third final round consisted of an hr interview in which you given scenario and to explain how you would the problem  the round an interview round in which candidates expected to demonstrate their understanding of dsa and run simple programmes  the first round divided into two parts with the first half of multiple choice questions coding question and the second half of video session in which your responses to specific questions recorded and uploaded there rounds in total  round is technical interview in which questions regarding data structures and time complexcity rd round is hr round which mainly focuses on questions related to me  what your long

cities exist  st round resume shortlisting  the role offered non technical business related role so wasn any technical questions  they threw in lot of the usual behavioral situational questions that you see in hr interviews like your strengths and weaknesses  everything they you is based on what you put on on your resume so you need to know exactly what s on  the interviewers really friendly and the entire interview just felt like conversation  the final round personal interview  you have to the best speaker in your group to make through to the next round  exxon really uses the gd to eliminate most people so extremely important to have amazing communication skills  we split into groups of about with one from each group making to the next round  almost everyone that applied got shortlisted for the next round which group discussion  the cutoff to apply  the first round resume shortlist  what the project final outcome ? what did learn from the project ? what the methodology logic behind the working of your project ? at the end of the selections only students selected  the rd round also resume based technical interview hr the interviewer my about my previous interview experience and questions related to the projects in the resume in addition to this he also interested in any other projects apart from the ones in the resume what the difficulties and challenges faced in them  the round completely resume based technical interview questions based upon the projects in the resume the interviewer also questions on the previous work internship experience what will you do if you given data of million people which ml algorithm will you use ? what would the outcome ? have you ever worked in health insurance company ? do you have any corporate project job experience ? at the end what would your and the company s gain from this internship ? after this round students shortlisted for next round  after this round students shortlisted for the interviews  mcqs based on ml algorithms sql queries oopm concepts the coding questions easy medium level  the st round aptitude test which parts st part test mcq technical coding of minutes and part communication video test in which we to answer the personal question on the screen and would recorded in video there rounds in total  six students selected after the first interview and at the end five students selected  both the interviews questions based on my resume and few questions based on ml in first interview and hr questions in the next  after this students selected for the st interview  mcqs included mix of ml dbms aptitude oops and programming questions  interview mainly based on all c basicsin total online test and interviews online test mcqs coding questions and video communication test first there resume shortlist then direct interview  towards the end of the interview hr questions like what knew about micron as well as why chosen ece  also about what dram and ssds  the interviewer then went through the projects on my resume and questions about them in detail as well as my role in the project  following this some questions in ece related to microprocessors and vlsi  also questions on data structures and algorithms like trees and linked lists  questions on the basics of c programming followed by which the interviewer me to write an easy c program and show to him  the interview involved mixture of technical as well as hr questions  always do concluding question when given an opportunity as shows your curiosity and enthusiasm about the company !the first round involved resume shortlisting of students following which students called for interviews  about micron to which he explained about the company their customers worldwide and why this profile is unique  then given chance to question  moving on to hr part there questions on my activities which included public speaking and how built on about my hobbies and my future goal  the last technical question about ssd as to why s better than hd and about microprocessors  there also questions on os to define cpu scheduling and distributed os  to write pseudo code to implement doubly linked lists following which their applications in everyday life and to draw doubly linked list on sheet of paper there questions on malloc and which section of the application memory would allocated to to define dangling pointers and wild pointers  to code for that as well and explain every iteration  chose the iterative method as we traverse only half the string that way  then the most efficient way to reverse string options being using stack iterative method or recursive method  then to share my screen and write series of c programs  once brief description of my project questioned about http client server interaction and the various python libraries used in my project and their functionalities  about my project which on web scraping  my interview went on for about an hour the next round technical hr interview  there initially resume based shortlisting after which students shortlisted  next round technical hr interviewthe company open for cs ece and eee students shortlisted based on resume  so they might such real life problems to on the spot  they more interested in us being able to study their industrial systems and suggest any modifications and not exactly to design anything from scratch  also basic mechanical engineering questions related to gears drives which mostly from second year subjects  as good projects which complete knowledge about could answer any question related to my projects round resume shortlisting round online interview  the second round the technical and hr interview together and mostly resume based with few common hr questions as well  in addition to this there behavioral test conducted com problem sql retail stores dd f ea com practice algorithms dynamic programming dimensional practice problems algorithm dynamic programming and sql question https www first round an online coding test for mins on hackerearth that technical mcqs covering concepts of oops dsa fundamentals of programming and few general aptitude logical questions programming question https www  st round s online test mcqs and coding question easy sql query question round s technical hr round and in the interview they about the field am working at present and said ml and he some questions on and some regular hr questions  questions also based on their products turbochargers  again given drawing and to talk about  questions based on my projects design very few related to my area of interest  my interview more inclined towards tech than hr  round two personal interview both technical and hr  around eight to ten students shortlisted for the next round  bullet trains does india really need them ? the topic for non technical gd  for technical gd we given an engineering drawing about which we to discuss one of the parts of turbocharger p  round one gd each batch two gds technical and non technical  only people with cgpa greater than shortlisted for gd round zero gpa based shortlisting around thirty students shortlisted based on gpa  you can expect basic hr questions here nothing specific  next up hr which went very well  my interview pretty much resume based technical questions related to the projects that have worked on  the required skills for the job and that s all the interviewer expecting  they needed someone who could design pcb and has worked on hardware projects before  as result of which interested students from ece could have walk in interview  my branch wasn even eligible until the day of interviews and just so happened that they needed ec students for their profile  st round test round technical interview and rd round hr  went on for mins and included questions about my projects fields of interest and lot of questions on automobiles followed by typical hr questions  the second round technical hr interview  non technical gd on covid s impact on the economy  technical gd based on an eg sheet where we to discuss what the drawing about and small details in the drawing  first round gd round which consisted of technical and non technical gd round cgpa based shortlisting only people above selected for the first round  finally they some general non technical question and if any questions for the company  second round technical interview where they mostly about projects listed in resume and then technical questions of which somewhat related to my projects  first round coding where they questions of easy medium difficulty there only rounds this year from the candidates given final offers  and then she some basic cs questions and then in the end some hr ones  then she me to explain my project which to minimise the cashflow between group of people  then told him that can break into subproblems but couldn think of way to do that  did that after that he me if can optimize the solution  first he told me to code and then explain  explained him the brute force solution  my interviewer first me dp question find the maximum length of palindromic substring in string  the round final round an online technical hr interview  candidates selected from this round  questions solved one fully and other partially  keep your introduction ready before interview which should include your area of interests and project related to in resume st round an online test on hackerrank  as an intern what can you offer to company like visa  some hr questions like why should we hire you ? describe downs in your life and how you tackled them

knowledge related to finance then they will questions related to those topics  in the first round they about my resume  after this there three rounds of interview  the first round an online test which have aptitude and finance related question this the first time credit suisse offered finance related role apart from their technical role  second round hr round where normal hr like questions  interviewer also about the projects in my resume first round after the online test technical interview where about object oriented programming basics and few questions about sql and told to write sql queries onlinr test consisted of aptitude questions and one coding questions  so you can expect anything  some of my friends hr interview for the second round  stay calm if the interviewer gives you some advice  if the questions very difficult just give your best answer  so make sure very good with the basics  and after that questions related to databases  to explain my projects again  depends on the interviewer what kind of questions he asks  round hr or another technical interview this round can an hr interview or technical interview  make sure that you will able to provide live demo of all the projects  so the interviewer picked on projects and questioned me based on that  included the projects that well versed with in my resume  round technical interview this interview mainly focused on my resume  mostly related to cloud computing and databases  the last round technical round and included questions related to the technologies used in their company  third round single coding question which for minutes second round general aptitute critical included questions that contained questions related to detecting patterns  critical aptitute coding and technical round online test this test consisted of four parts  round is hr round with questions like about achievements and goals and also some questions on the projects in the resume  in the round is technical interview based on the projects in the resume  round an online test with sections of aptitude logical reasoning technical and one coding question there rounds in the selection process  this round lasted for minutes  also he me about challenges which faced in college and my biggest achievement in the college  interviewer me whether know about company what will my role in internship and other questions  round hr round followed by live demo of my project  two hours later next round began  at last he me logic of bubble sort  this round went on for minutes  whatever didn knew just let the interviewer  since my project based on dbms he me almost all concepts of the database and sql  little discussion of oop concepts  the interviewer about my project and detailed discussion went on that  majority of these questions new for me  these questions based on probably the technology which the company uses  section against minutes  section having one simple coding problem  general aptitude test math puzzle english and short passages  section consisted of in minutes  all questions straight forward but point is to attempt maximum number of questions  this section to check the speed and accuracy of the candidates  section having and time minutes  consisted of four sections with time constraint  duration of exam hour  st round online test conducted on tests  st round aptitude technical round

the third round again more questions based on my projects  in the second round some puzzle type questions and python related questions  in the first interview round to explain my projects and some basic questions on os and oops  total of interview rounds  people shortlisted here for the interview rounds the first screening round min test with coding questions on the codility platform  we spoke about my strengths and hobbies and my drive for cs  they also me rather easy but challenging riddle to ! the next interview the hr interview where apart from couple of resume and techincal questions maybe the conversation mainly about my goals and passion  this followed by techinical interview which focused on oops concepts and resume enquiry the online test consisted of aptitude and coding questions  the third round an hr round  basic questions from oops and software engineering like phases of the sdlc life cycle also  then they me two puzzles  second round technical interview they me to introduce myself and explain the project did  gcd of the array elements first round online test the test conducted on the amcat platform which sections quantitative aptitude questions logical reasoning questions technical mcq coding questions given graph in the form of network of pipes that transports oil to the storage units determine the maximum amount of oil transported via the network at any given time  no lies only truth  prepare them in advance  hr listen ppt really well  so prepare your project well  wasn anything about my projects but my other friends  the he one simple puzzle and basic questions of coding in os told him approach but he wanted an exact code where messed up little managerial interview with my resume since lots of extra curricular activities like theatre and fest managements so interview revolved around that  even if you have in depth knowledge no problem  your basics should clear technical the basic question of all your gate cs subjects dbms os pointers oops array linkedlist stacks coding questions linkedlist detect and remove loop  and rd technical interview based on dsa os oops and projects mention in resumetotal rounds no written all interviews  st written round with ques in about mins  questions mainly based on the work you have in your projects  round group discussion topic make in india challenges and objectives rd round two interviews while some just one  st round written test with verbal quant logical and technical sections  and questions based on my projects they questions on dsa oops dbms there technical and one technical managerial round around people shortlisted for the interview you need to make sure your code works for edge cases as well as there only one submission allowed there easy and medium level coding questions online test conducted on codility platform  in the hr round mostly about my hobbies  the interview smooth he me questions based on my projects  the second round the technical interview and the third round being hr interview i solved both the coding questions and therefore hoping to get shortlisted  there questions coding questions  the first round an online test which included questions based on aptitude english and programming  luckily not under any stress and answering in such way that problem solver and not creator emphasis on answering in such way xd  so nice reply saying the motto is to learn and doing personal projects is always an option  luckily in covid situation you re not face to face and calm af  told them my seniors about this and also the previous interviewer well didn any of my seniors p but sounds like you re very interested in the company and did my previous interviewer about in the remaining minutes of the st interview and told them what the previous interviewer told me they cross questioned me saying would you do documentation for months ? so this is how stress interviews go  they me what knew about citi group standard question and what kind of projects they do  the rd round pure hr the interviewers tried to put me in spot  round technical hr round which minutes long where probably spoke for minutes explaining not one of my most authentic projects xd probably more of an hr round cause my resume pretty decent and that s what banks look for not investment banks they grill you on dsa and for the one only couple of test cases passed  solved just the st one  st round online round with few aptitude questions and coding problems one about finding gcd of an array and searching problem  by night they put up the list of the selected interns  my process and didn receive any further calls but some people got calls for one more round  in the hr round general hr round questions some puzzles  the next technical interview round where about my projects they went in depth for this round platforms have worked on basic oops questions and over  completed all three questions within the provided time frame  one question finding the smallest triangle which does not have any interior point for given set of points another finding the min number of string div so that no alphabet is repeated and the third finding total number of zero sum subarray for an array of size n  the time period alloted mins and the questions varied from easy to medium level  the first round coding round of questions and held on the platform codility  they me to explain one of my projects in detail and project on smart class rooms and since that s pretty simple choose to explain that instead of ml projects which generally harder to explain as delves into model architectureso the selection process began with resume shortlisting and almost everyone got through  the second round hr and that again introduce yourself and standard hr questions why citi what your strengths  ml as an interest and in my resume so he me to explain regression  then one simple puzzle which and some pattern printing which peace  the standard introduce yourself and then some basic oops concepts on function overloading  two rounds of interviews  cleared all the cases in both the cp questions and the rest of the paper frankly pretty chill  happened in cisco as well and in citi they repeated one question  they repeat coding questions pretty often  before company test s just refer gfg interview experiences  round divided into coding mcqs aptitude and coding questions the selection procedure divided into rounds  then they again talked with me about my introduction and focussed on previous work in college events clubs and elsewhere  technical questions related to my projects also too  then resume based project specific questions mostly  for me initially they for my introduction and talked bit about  round the hr interview  answered almost all so confident that ll get through  java questions on access modifiers java specific oops runtime polymorphism collections arraylist and linkedlists cp question  the interviewer me questions based on my intro  held at am over video call amcat  round the technical interview  total hours hour for cp hour for rest  for cp questions you could both at the same time  each section specific timer  you can go back to previous question once you submit or move past  round divided into coding mcqs aptitude english and cp questions serially the selection procedure divided into rounds  rd round an hr round for me few people few technical questions as well where they about my non academic interests and my background  they can basic cs questions as well  round managerial type interview where scenario based questions and to thoroughly explain my projects  rounds st round hr test with aptitude software english and coding questions  then he ended the interview by asking if any questions for him  he bit about what learnt in my minors and few basic questions from dbms  he refrained from asking from there  told him that haven studied operating systems yet  then he me to code simple program count the minimum number of powers of will take to represent number that occupies bytes basically the number of s in the binary representation in long int  asking me to modify step by step as he kept taking components off  he very funky questions involving dsp processors mux flip flops with multiple clock inputs  after introducing myself we discussing about one of my other projects which an embedded system part to  round this round turned out to more fun than the previous one  then he me about projects in my resume  he let me code in java though they usually prefer c at texas instruments  round to explain sampling theorem and nyquist rate signal processing theorem implement given equation using nor gates both normal one and the one using the minimum number of gates basic bit manipulation coding that did using recursion and then in one step  interviewer me pretty basic though extremely diverse questions maybe since from eee  rounds of interviews both technical online round applied for only software profile so questions restricted to aptitude c programming mcqs theoretical coding oops concepts and data bit manipulation  every cliche hr questions from the book  last round traditional hr round  he me puzzle towards the end of the round  talked about some of the projects did fav and least fav subjects and why sdlc life cycles  round technical fit round this round more like conversation with the interviewer  whole lot of theory questions from oops and dsa and some very easy programming questions like implement linked list implement queue using stack write program with some polymorphism program for matrix multiplication  interview first round this an easy technical round online test two programming questions  this basically background check that lasted for minutes but do not go in easy into this round as only eight out of the ten people offered internships  about ten students shortlisted for the last round the hr round  all the questions typical managerial questions you find on the internet  but not any technical questions  for round that would technical managerial round  also included what programming languages use libraries know their functions  also about dbms os and networking but wasn too deep into the topic  then the interviewer me basic dsa questions which if you well prepared you can answer confidently  about my interests and some questions around them  about people shortlisted for interviews  we time limit of minutes for one question and an hour for the other one  all of us given different questions  the question s difficulty ranged from easy to medium  students who cleared the cutoffs for both round and round shortlisted to take the coding round round  similar to the round we get practice tests for this round too  you have to fast in calculations and analyzing data in this round  all the shortlisted students from round got mail with link for round quantitative round  suggest you look into them as you get an idea of the type of questions they  they give us links to practice tests  then we to take logical reasoning test which round  this round not an elimination round  the first round strength test where we given bunch of scenarios and we to rank the given responses in the order we see right  before all this the company shortlisted students based on their resume the company seven rounds in which of them tests and the other interviews  some questions from communication also little bit different from that being in first round  in this they dsp digital signal processing like sampling aliasing effect and questions from filters  second round also about to minutes tech subjects like wireless communication and mimo  some questions from our  slightly they moved onto some advanced concepts like iq impairments and distortion  they with digital communication like different modulation schemes qpsk bpsk  they look for people specific to their need so particular about projects you mention in resumefirst round almost around minutes  followed by this an interview that mainly based on resume and some questions related to oops and dsa  st round test of mcqs and coding problems  they me about my programming language proficiency  in the second round they me about my projects in the resume and about my technical interests and questions related to my technical interest  mcq based on dsa and other core cs topics there an online round with mcq questions and coding questions  at the end of all four rounds nine people got selected  more of doubt clearing session for the applicants  the interviewer mostly told me about what wells fargo does and what is expected of an intern at wells fargo  hr interview round this relatively short round lasting only for around minutes  this round lasted for minutes  seemed like mix of technical and hr round  there some cs fundamentals questions as well from topics like dbms os and computer networks  interview round the interviewer me some basic dsa questions resume discussion and

in which the interviewer mainly me questions about my resume and topics in my resume  around people shortlisted after this test  the test held on the amcat platform  the coding section two questions of moderate difficulty but the questions differed for each person taking the test online screening round an online screening test that included sections on english logical analysis data interpretation

digital electronics and verilog  this very brief as they late on schedule  hr round in this round to give an introduction and talk about all my details such as projecte interests family  puzzles in this round too  to explain my projects in detail and then given situations in team project and what would have  round this more of behavioural round  also puzzle at the end  interview st round in this round tested on the bery basics and fundamentals such as concepts in c programs and dsa  the second one dp question  the first one simple but tricky question online test the test consisted of programming questions  round technical interview they with regular introduction and then according to your area of interest questions being they not going too deep into the topics but careful about what you speak as you can expect follow up question  thermodynamics strength of materials and manufacturing questions easy ones and test more of them as well  st round technical test and very basic questions an easy to moderate minute test  digital electronics covered the maximum part of the digital system design logical and sequential circuits fsms along with that there couple of questions on verilog too one or two  analog electronics involves lot of questions regarding opamps and transistors and also regarding buffer and amplifiers  aptitude and basic coding analog electronics and digital electronics  st round online test which comprised of sections  later there hr round with questions like what do you know about the company who s rivals and so on  then there interview rounds where few questions on aptitude os and few dsa questions and to code the solutions first round an online test with mcqs and coding questions a few easy hr questions then i system design kind of question where we we both discussed different approaches and their scalabilities the second round bit weird this followed by puzzle and coding question i then to code the approaches used in my project as well in the first round questions mainly based on the projects in my resume i rounds of interview apart from that oracle s test is easier compared to other companies which follow mcq based pattern it s better to know about their implementation before taking this test  lot of questions in basic programming based on avl trees and expression trees the st round an online test with many different sections for aptitude math english basic programming oops dbms  at the end whenever the interviewer asks you if you have any questions make sure you have something to because that shows your interest  hr round after two rounds of interview the hr round pretty chill round where the the interviewer me why wanted to join cisco ? why particular profile  after this we discussion based on cricket and public speaking both of which in my resume so bluff anything on your resume  then we discussion based on the profile for internship  he me few basic questions some could answer and some he explained the basic concept and me logical questions based on that  told him that basics of that in my grade  then he proceeded to networks  he then moved on to questions from os and me to explain some concepts and give practical example such that lay man could understand  then he me question combining both where he checked if understood the concept and satisfied with my answer  he me questions on deep learning and signal processing  after brief discussion about my projects he moved to the skills section of my resume  then after that he me to introduce myself  for my second interview the interviewer by asking me about current news  you should always keep checking updates as they come and not assume stuff  here there is something you need to take care  always think out loud because tells the interviewer about your and logic skills they look for that too technical interview shortly after the first interview got call for my second round  to improvise the code based on the interviewer s stress on the time complexity  after this he moved on to coding question from dsa  just in hurry to answer even if the answer seems direct think and then answer  if you have prepared the basics well those can answered  he me questions from os dsa  then he moved on to questions  this went for about minutes  then he took up couple more projects me to explain them  apart from technical questions related to projects even about how managed to coordinate with other team members as we working remotely for course project  here there is one more point to note mention only those projects you confident about because the interviewer cross questions and checks if you have considered all possible methods before choosing particular approach for your project  once introduced my self he moved to my projects  keep the introduction short and speak for too long  here make sure you state whatever you have in your resume to say something more about yourself so that the interviewer gets to

rounds followed by hr round  round once you qualify the first round you move to the interview round  in online test round to answer as many questions as you can and avoid random marking of answers in case there is negative marking  we allowed to use only one of three languages java python c  followed by two coding questions  mcqs which included questions from various topics like os network dbms and dsa  st round the first round an online test conducted on hackerrank  round hr some general hr questions like what do you know about cisco who its main competitors my location preferences  what is the minimum number of weights you need to take to find which stack is defective ? not able to give the optimized solution at once but the interviewer hints to do that few hr questions too  however one stack of coins is defective and each coin in that stack weighs only gms  each coin weighs gms  there stacks of coins each  fill bucket of litres with the help of and litre jug in minimum number of steps  round managerial two easy questions on linked lists and graphs two puzzles  round technical firstly questions from the projects on my resume and then questions from dsa stacks linked lists

bob the time always in hh mm ss hours format  input in the form of comma separated  you given list of strings which indicated at what time of the day an employee of company checked in and checked out of the company on particular day com problems h round coding test conducted on hackerrank platform of mcqs on dsa dbms oops os networks aptitude and two coding questions in which only languages c python and java allowed  round the hr round  there coding question too which based on the binary trees  the rd round technical interview round mainly based on my projects and tools and technologies written in my resume  the question to sort the string in the custom order which will provided  he me two code questions for which to write sudo code in online editor  round technical interview that mainly emphasis on puzzles and coding questions  around people shortlisted for the next round mcq contain some coding part which of medium hard level and mainly based on bst and avl trees  st round technical algorithmic round technical resume and algorithmic rd round hiring managerfirst round an online test that consists of mcq of various fields testing aptitude os and dbms  then there hr round in which about my achievements and challenges faced  then they me about my projects in my resume  and also basic compiler design questions and computer organisation and architecture related questions  after the online test round then there technical interview where coding questions and operating systems related questions first round an online test which sections aptitude c programming and technical mainly  os concepts can from gfg or youtube so to keep projects you comfortable with in resume some questions also from os and projects  both technical interviews mostly based on dsa questions from graph tries binary trees strings bit manipulation and greedy algorithms  interviews technical interviews and hr  people shortlisted for interviews i solved questions correctly  st round coding round consisted of questions each of easy greedy medium binary search with some precomputations on array and hard level remember well but from flow of graphs  the rd round of interview the hr interview which only about minutes long with questions like what all do you know about cisco who the main competitors  also there some hr kind of questions like tell me about when you overcame difficulty dealt

that number x  given string find all possible palindromes in  quizzed on related ml concepts like types of neural networks different optimisers used in tensorflow and lstm  since worked on stock price predictor went with that  rd round to explain the most recent project did  given decimal number manipulate the bit at the specified location  difference between an exe file in python and java  approach for finding loop in linked list containing unique elements  round in depth discussion about the various projects listed on my resume com please suggest me an efficient algorithm and easy to understand for this problem s graph problem and after mins of trying could only pass test cases so left  question this is puzzle  you can use regex for this but did using normal python split and int arr  then you have to traverse the list checking if the input time lies in between the start and the end  approach since s in hr format makes our job easier all we have to do is remove the separating hours minutes and seconds and convert the string to int  you have to find out the number of meetings taking place at given time input which is given in the same format  basically you given the start and end time of meetings as strings hh mm ss in hr format  st question this string manipulation problem  there also some aptitude questions and coding questions  st round hackerrank test which consisted of basic questions from c python and java  only one round for analog happened no hr for me for digital questions mostly on sta  for analog interview first round questions based on opamps rc circuits i got selected for analog and digital  based on the test you will selected for three profiles digital analog eda online test consists of three sections aptitude analog digital for hardware  brief hr round on phone call where questions like what your future plans ? how you managing your studies at home ?  to the delays in them advantages and disadvantages of jkff over sr  b w ffs and latches buffer and inverter using exor clock generation with inverters in series and calculation of clock period acc  the questions based on very basic digital diff  members in the panel questions one by one  technical interview on webex  people got shortlisted for interviews in different profiles  questions in analog bit tougher digital conceptual aptitude easy  online test of sections analog digital aptitude software section also there for those who applied for hardware software profile there rounds in the overall procedure  the final hr round very quick they for my interests and preferences in subjects and the reasons for being so and inquired if there any problems faced because of the interview being virtual  in my case also called for second technical round where logical and general aptitude questions  the questions mainly about logic gates muxes finite state machines counters frequency dividers mosfet implementation of combinational circuits speed and power efficiency of circuits  an online whiteboard used to questions explain and draw diagrams and to answer in written form  except for the necessity for good internet connection there wasn any problems with the virtual nature of  the next round two rounds interview rounds which held virtually due to the pandemic  besides the aptitude section there digital analog and embedded software sections depending on the profiles you have applied for  the first round an online test which video proctored in total there three rounds in the selection procedure  the interviewer general questions like tell me something about yourself why do want to work at walmart what do you know about walmart  rd round the hr round for minutes  also to explain my projects and later the interviewer questions on the projects  the interview for around minutes  round technical interview where questions on oops and data structures and algorithms  st round an online test which consisted of mcqs on oops concepts os dbms  the hr round chill as usual and we nice discussion about the covid situation and how we have been dealing with  for the system design he just saw my approach and what data structure would use  then implementation type question and system design question  even in the second round about my resume  all easy medium level  in the first round about my resume and project  coming to the interviews we rounds technical and hr  along with coding there networking based questions and oops questions the first round an online test which consisted of coding questions easy and medium  finally thevenin theorem question of an infinite ckt  then they transfer function ckt unknown with lot of src terms and what will the new transfer function if the resistor and capacitor in the whole ckt interchanged replace src by src  this questions finally boiled down to fundamental ckt analysis and knowing the input resistance expression  they explained all the necessary details and what will the input resistance of the circuit not opamp which is vin iin  the second question some opamp with two input and two output  then they me voltage waveform at the inverting terminal v will zero till opamp saturated and then reach vin v with an exponential waveform because of rc circuit  output waveform to draw decreases till vcc and saturates  the opamp supply constraints  for the technical interview the first question they showed an opamp integrator ckt which unit step input  for the final round we an hr round where questions about what going on in the college and lot of questions about my resume  the interview on webex and there some problem in my outgoing video due to which couldn show my rough work diagrams to them my camera fine some problem with webex to explain thoroughly  you will distributed in one or multiple of sw sw digital analog and eda interview panels  then you will shortlisted for interview round based on how you fared in the test  embedded ten questions for minutes and aptitude questions in minutes  the analog and digital section questions for minutes each  the test minutes long and four sections analog digital embedded and aptitude initially we to fill form in which they for general details and the profile you interested in hardware software hardware software based on which you will writing tests  then the hr round conducted through phone call  the interviewer also extended the time allotted to questions about my projects which have on my resume  in the interview the interviewer with rc rl and rlc circuits like their frequency response unit step response then there questions on opamps and mosfets and in the end he questions on bode plots  shortlisted for the analog internship interview round  felt that the questions in the aptitude part simple and easy to score marks  there questions on rc rl rlc circuits amplifiers buffers mosfets in the analog part the digital part questions related to combinational and sequential circuits and on verilog as well  analog and the digital sections to completed in minutes each and the aptitude section in minutes  the test three sections namely analog digital and aptitude the first round of screening an online test hr round the chillest round as should guess in second round questions based on my resume projects but majority of them related to web development and one coding question which too ezz  anyone who does cp regularly won find difficult the first round technical round which consisted of coding questions based on tree maps which kind of between easy medium and couple of question based on sql  they few questions related to my future plans and my interests in mechanical engineering  most of the questions about the projects on my resume  some people interviews but just one  round group discussion topic make in india challenges and objectives  st round an online test which some verbal quant logical and technical questions  round hr round questions about one self to see and analyze whether the candidate can fit in well with others  third round involved purely coding question one by one and cross questioning over the concepts and solution approach  second round consisted of basic subject and project knowledge testing questions and cross questioning  coa cpu architecture os schedulingfirst round consisted of few coding and subject related questions  dsa bloom filters avl red black trees and applications of these data structures  the interviewer particularly interested in what learn other than acads whether aware of latest tech and how updated myself whether read any blogs related to tech projects on any new tech  make sure you have added both team and individual projects on your resume  rd round off with project discussion  they informed us right after the interview whether you ve made to the next round or not  coding very basic reverse string average of elements in array  os cpu scheduling differences between linux and windows  dsa basic questions like explain difference between stacks queues their applications and implementing them  round there little discussion about my projects before starting off with the questions each section time constraint  there no coding questions unlike other companies  sections aptitude os dbms networking concepts dsa oops english  st round mcq based  rd round hr they didn take this round for me  if you pay enough attention in the class you can answer them with no second thought  not very intuitive as such  the questions they basic in nature  towards the end there few behavioural and managerial questions like how would you tackle this ? what would you suggest your sub ordinate ?  then the panel cross questioned me based on my field of interests thermo fluids my projects and my club work  off with typical introduction for about minutes  my interview lasted for minutes  told earlier that this round would around minutes for some weird reason xd  round this technical interview  you have to quick in order to answer questions in minutes considering the number of people who shortlisted only from mechanical side  the topics they covered thermodynamics fluid mechanics machine design manufacturing processes strength of materials and mechanics of machines  the questions different for everybody  st round minute technical test which conducted via an online proctored exam  general hr questions like strengths weakness achievements why samsung ?  rd round hr interview  also some dsa problems on sorting pointers and also puzzles  even though for software profile they on digital also because of my branch  st round online coding round for hours with single question  note hr round is also an elimination round in oracle  then there some general hr questions that  also the interviewer me how can modify one of my project and deploy so that can help us fight covid  about my projects in depth and some easy questions regarding system design like how can make my projects scalable and deploy them in real world  rd round last round this the hr round for me  after that thy quetions regarding oop s dbms os in depth  then given dsa problems of medium difficulty to in any language preferred  so explained one project which did on the graph database  after that he told me to explain my project s  first he his introduction and then me to give my introduction  round this the hr technical round for me  there few questions on avl trees so revise very well before the test  sections covered general aptitude english reasoning basics of coding in c and flow diagram of certain codes given with some missing blocks and we to identify the missing blocks finally people called for hr which very simple round basic hr question st round online test conducted on their platform  in this round he with my project discussion in very detailed manner then he me some question based on langauges and framework on my resume he me to explain each layer in osi model how each layer is important then futher what is runtime polymorphism and to code  people got selected for round  after that he me basic os and oops with mysql as is present in my resume then one simple puzzle and told me to implement stack and then he told me code to print one particaular pattern  in the first interview he with tell me about yourself then he me some situation and me which data structure you will use  along with that coding question which based on sorting and dp where around people applied and from that got selected for interviews we online test as our first round here we some basic mcqs with oops db os and networks  rd round hr just casual chat and more of formality  got selected for the third round hr in digital profile some people two technical rounds embedded section questions in c microprocessors and data structures  in software profile questions on c and microprocessors  questions from basic gates mux flops latch timing diagrams fsms sta lot around cmos inverter parasitic components  digital interview spanned over minutes  round interview selected for both digital and software profile  digital section questions of moderate level but tricky questions from combinational sequential circuits counters also verilog questions  the analog section tricky and difficult the questions from opamps mosfets rc circuits bjts  based on your performance you could called for interview in any of the three profiles or all of them  sections aptitude questions minutes analog questions minutes digital questions minutes embedded questions minutes  wrote for hardware software

online test com problems asteroid collision org score of parentheses using tree technical interview round coding question  interviewer okay with swapping data so just one line code  swapping linked list nodes pairwise  technical interview round coding question  online coding round coding question in min easy medium hard  coding round and interview rounds  keep the interviewer engaged and probing questions about their experience and this round would no big deal  typical questions like how the online coding round where do you see yourself on your career path years from now  interview pure hr round  mostly high level ideas expected no deep knowledge of system design required  also the interviewer one open ended question on designing infrastructure for an online store along with ideas for handling sudden spikes in usage  since that s what people want to know  its good idea to prepare short story about each section in the resume along with what you learned difficulties  interview questions purely based on my resume  in the end given offers  people selected for further rounds  one basic dsa question on implementing fast modular exponentiation  covering the core concepts in each will enough  rd round pure hr interview with all the cliche questions like what do you know about walmart do you like to work in team st round mcqs based on os dbms oop and networks  round technical interview mainly questions from my projects  round coding round mcqs from subjects like os dbms and coding question somewhat related to modular exponentiation i given an option to choose between analog and digital from which chose digital after this interview got two phone calls from analog hr and eda hr  at the end of interview he told the work description in the second interview they rc circuits and basics of sta and also one c program to write the complete code for recursive problem the interviewer me rapid fire round as well after the three interviews got call for second technical interview for eda profile and that lasted for hour with some slightly tougher questions it depends on the interviewer on what they choose to all the interviews pretty chill and the questions from pure basics and not even from my resume for me i got selected for digital analog and eda related to digital profile for interviews questions from analog really tough but digital questions from basics there an online written test which consisted of analog digital and aptitude for hardware test  also questions related to the projects that on my resume  then rounds of technical interviews and in these questions about c programming basics few data structures questions and bit manipulation algorithms related questions and questions in operating systems  this test involved an aptitude section and another section which involved questions on operating systems and c programming basics and microprocessors first round an online test in which seperate tests given for different profiles and chosen software lastly he ended with explaining all visibiliy scope in oops he me to design tree adt using oops concepts i to list all data structure im familier with he me to code for evaluating postfix expression the rd round technical interview round mainly based on my projects and tools and technologies written in my resume the ques to selling and buying of stock doing as many transaction ans possible for maximizing profit he me one code ques which needs to run on online editor  round technical interview which mainly emphasis on os oops and dbms around people shortlisted for the next round mcq contain some coding part which of medium hard level and mainly based on bst and avl trees  overall great and nice experience ! !first round an online test which consists mcq of various fields testing aptitude os and dbms  after this round students selected for the internship  then she me what do you know about our company and that s  the interviewer first about my introduction and background then she me how am spending lockdown  just felt like friendly conversation  round the hr round of mins  after this round students selected for round  the basic understanding of every concept in these subjects will give the best results  in this round interviewer mainly focused on my project and after that he questions from dsa os and oops  after that round technical interview  they shortlisted approx students  the question to find the number of ways to divide n persons in rooms such that at least person is there in each room ans n all test cases will pass if we implement pow function in o log n complexity first round consists of sections the first section consists of some mcqs of aptitude os and coding input output types and the second section consists of programming question org function to check if singly linked list is palindrome this round smooth and got both questions completely and if any questions for her  she for o n time and o space complexity directly https www  check if the given singly linked list of characters is palindrome or not  an intermediate level stack question  she also coding questions  technical interview round duration hr again the round with brief introduction about the interviewer and me  then he if any questions for him  even though solved the first question before as well got stuck on but the interviewer really helped me to calm the whole time and worked out org score of parentheses using tree the interviewer really friendly  both iterative and recursion solution https www org pairwise swap adjacent nodes of linked list by changing pointers set  swapping data wasn allowed p https www  swapping linked list nodes pairwise  then the interviewer jumped on directly to coding questions  technical interview round duration hr off with intro  just to more than questions  passed all test cases in questions and in one  fill an nx board with colors such that no row or column consists of only one color backtracking but huge so didn attempt  some intermediate level graph question  in tree not binary tree delete an edge from the tree such that the absolute difference of the sum of nodes in both halves of the tree is minimum  output for example input would  you have to delete elements from this array such that the number of distinct ids in the list is minimum  an array of items with their ids and integer is given eg  simple greedy and sorting  divide an array of numbers in minimum groups such that each group s max absolute difference is less than equal to k  hackerrank webcam enabled the questions  okay let s break down ! online coding round duration mins coding questions ranging from easy to hard difficulty  coding round and interview rounds  interview round hr again dsa questions difficulty medium  interview round hr dsa questions difficulty medium online coding test min coding problems easy medium hard  luckily answered all these questions correctly round hr round this just for formality to know about our interests which spanned over min prove this my favourite question  can we say normal calculator universal gate can we have infinity frequency for sequential circuit derive formula for max frequency in sequential circuit explain setup and hold time can we prove mux as an universal gate difference between latch and flipflop explain both mealy and moore model with pros and cons of each model design digital system for oven  round interview round selected for digital round  the second round an online interview which felt like both hr and technical mixed and of minutes at max chill and mainly about can you get your hands dirty and one or two technical questions mostly from my resume st round aptitude questions analog electronics questions digital electronics questions and programming questions for the people who chose software profile also there rounds basically one online test of minutes duration consisted some of the questions similar to gate and also some conceptual questions bit tricky but overall the test simple enough  st round coding round round technical interview rd round hr interview st round resume shortlist round interview questions on our resume and principles of management  though only rounds of interview many others upto rounds of interviews  after around mins of this he me couple of hr questions and frankly surprised at the lack of dsa questions  the next round another interview which with the interviewer asking me lot of questions about of my projects and oops concepts  he also me some questions on basic os and dbms  the interviewer talked about my resume and projects for around mins and then me to explain any shortest path algorithms knew went with dijsktra  the round is usually technical round and depending on how goes will determine how many total rounds you will face the st round an online test with many different sections for aptitude math english basic programming oops dbms  again to give small presentation on ai and ml in the hr round  the hr round more about the interviewer describing the company  in the second round to write sql queries and to give minute presenation on ai and ml since few ml courses on my resume  the focus probably more on how well you code the solution than the logic of the solution since the problems quite simple  the first technical interview one puzzle and two simple questions to code with no language restrictions by my interviewer atleast coded in python  the selection procedure involved an online test mostly aptitude based followed by two rounds of technical interviews and an hr interview i extended pio based on selection in second year  this followed by medium level dsa problem  technical round this round majorly dealt with os concepts like deadlocks semaphores producer consumer problem inter process communication life cycle of network call  students made to the next round  later on many theoretical concepts like types of time complexities master s theorem file system followed by an easy dsa question  the interviewer also me to give the demo of my previous internship work  technical round questions on my resume to begin with  students shortlisted after this  even the time of submission taken into account for the shortlisting  coding test hour long coding test with dsa problems easy medium and tough  we did not have an hr round because they running short on time  questions mostly of medium level difficulty  made me code few questions  round this again an interview mainly based on dsa and oops  other than that there few questions from c programming and os theory as well  questions mainly based on my resume  round virtual interview this pretty straight forward round  they shortlist good number of people from round  there no negative marks for wrong answers  every section an allotted time  general aptitude logical reasoning english c c based questions theory and output based  full mcq type paper  st round an online round  in depth questions from projects on resume as well as the work did in my previous internship  rd round technical interview on zoom  to code simple file based question  questions based on resume as well  various in depth questions from os and dsa  all mcqs no coding based questions round technical interview on zoom  st round online test of various sections and subsections from topics such as dsa oops output type questions english proficiency aptitude based questions  simple questions on probability statistics integration  rd and rounds for mins each and based on maths in none of the rounds to code only logic important  they majorly focused on oops concepts like virtual functions diamond inheritence data structures like linked list stacks queues bsts avl tree red black tree simple questions on trees  st and rounds for mins each and technical  there in total of interviews  medium level tree problems online test mcq s on probability maths and coding questions in the end students shortlisted the interviewer very friendly in hr interview they questions on leadership skills if not hired by morgan stanley what would my reaction risk taken and is not guilty of and many more questions of that sort in the technical part coding question on trees code to written on notepad once the approach given right few questions on oops concepts some dsa questions and also to design basic version of amazon prime the next round hr technical interview there students shortlisted for the next round there enough time for each section it consisted of three sections namely aptitude debugging and coding problems the first round an online test  after this round students offered internship  the second round of interview the hr round lasting for around minutes having general questions about myself and how would work in team  totally this round lasted for around hour min  this followed by medium level coding questions which required explanation of approach as well as coding the solution on notepad  the first round of interview purely technical and began with few basic concepts and applications of oops followed by some basic concepts of os  around students short listed for interviews  the online test consisted of sections an aptitude section of mcqs for min code debugging section for min and finally coding round having coding questions for min an online test followed by rounds of interviews  the interviewer also me to show the code for some of them and explain what happening in particular section  the second round detailed discussion on the projects in my resume  in the first round tree based dsa question and then the interviewer moved on to networks compilers and os questions as projects related to them in my resume  about people shortlisted for the interviews  surprisingly no coding questions  st round an online test with four sections covering aptitude os dbms and dsa all questions mcqs  every interview also questions related to my previous internships as well as few hr questions  mostly questions on dsa since that my strength  this followed by rounds of interviews  aptitude cs fundamentals math sections of coding  hour long coding test with sections  couldn answer this any better than brute force with backtracking after the questions we moved onto decision about threads and processes deadlocks and database management systems  to clarify for iidd the answer would  given binary string where there only and characters and each character represents to increment or decrement the value find the smallest lexicographical permutation  to the following two problems given an array of non negative integers and the only operation you can do is to double an element can you make all elements equal ? felt the question vague and clarified whether to find minimum operations or to answer whether s possible  built rapport with one of the interviewers  second technical interview the third interview with introductions  overall didn write any code for this interview and indeed pressed my understanding of multi threading and  solved in o n using kmp not sure if there any better answers  the interview ended with the following puzzle given n x n crossword how would you find if the given string matches the crossword  then we talked about the compilation process of c files static variables particularly in multi threaded and multi process systems singleton classes  first technical interview my second interview with the following puzzle given that st jan is monday find the number of friday the ths  the questions not hard although the rigid timing of each section added pressure  online round the online round unusually timed for there limits on how long you can on particular section unlike competitive contests where you can decide how you want to spend time on  this the end of the selection procedure  at the end the interviewer me why wanted to join oracle  towards the end of the interview given dsa problem to which of average difficulty  the interviewer gone through my resume in detail and me about couple of projects my previous internship bit on the coding languages and tech stacks that  the second interview based lot on my resume  they made me run few test cases as well  the last part of the interview tested my dsa skills given fairly simple dsa problem and to code on an online code editor  couple of questions on dbms os and an open ended system design based question  the first interview in some sense general interview wherein questions on various topics  around people selected for the next round  the mcq s consisted of wide range of topics like english proficiency puzzles data structures c programming outputs and logical the first round consisted of only mcq s which quite different from the other company tests  in my second technical round dsa question and to explain projects on my resume  in the first technical round two dsa questions and two puzzles  there technical rounds and hr round first round an online round that mcqs on aptitude oops dbms and c questions  finally hr round this simple chill round  third round bit longer in this round questions on puzzles oops especially diamond inheritance virtual functions abstract classes and some more twisted questions on oops after that some os questions followed by dsa questions in which to explain bst and the implemetation of hash maps in c and some other dsa questions  in second round they to explain project which have followed by some puzzles dsa and oops questions  in first round they me some questions on aptitude probability bays theorem mathematics questions and some on c python concepts there interviews round of technical hr after the round around students shortlisted for interviews  round online test paper quant online assessment they have questions on topics section aptitude section mathematics probability combinatorics and other basic maths portions touched some linear algebra questions also present espeically the eigen values ones coding mcq questions comprised of input output and oops followed by paper coding assessment questions mins round resume shortlisting only selected students allowed to sit for the next round  at multiple points during the interview he me if any questions for him  to explain each of my projects in detail and he me questions on the practical use cases of them and even some system design questions based on one of my projects  only questions based on my resume this round  my next round another interview  next system design question and finally given very simple dsa question and to code and execute on codepair given an array of integers change every element in the array that s less than the average to the average itself and print the array  that hadn worked much with sql and experience with nonrelational databases and he then me questions based on that  next he wanted to me dbms based questions  then he moved on to os and me few definitions  the interviewer me some basic questions on dsa like what is stack queue  the next round an interview on zoom  about people selected from this round first round an online test with coding language and aptitude mcq s but surprisingly no coding questions online coding round on samsung software followed by technical interview  the questions based on data structures and algorithms dsa database management system dbms and operating system concepts os  this round bit harder than the previous round round  round again technical interview  the questions in this interview on object oriented programming concepts oops and data structures and algorithms  round coding test which consisted of three problems there total of three rounds  the last round hr round  the round resume round where about the projects and other details on my resume along with programming questions  st technical round consisted of puzzles and some coding questions in c  there technical rounds and hr  the st round an online round which consisted of aptitude and questions on c this actually pio so my interview actually held in year in the month of feb  after this shortlist of interns announced  the second and third round last for around min each and at the end of each interview the interviewer me why wanted to join oracle  the last technical question how would you create datastructure for polynomial using oops linked lists using classes and objects  this followed by few basic dbms questions and also few os questions ipc org sort an array of s s and s which able to in min with working code on the codepair platform  the interviewer me dsa question https www  the third round similar to the second one with the grilling about the projects on my resume part  with that this round over  and then he me to explain another project on my resume which based on cnns for which to explain the inner workings of cnn  this followed by dsa question write program to print the level order traversal of tree bfs  after this the interviewer proceeded to grill me on the implementation specifics for the project  in my introduction since told my hobby gaming the interviewer me if something on that and to explain the gamedev project on my resume  wear something formal as how you look matters at least shirt  there only one interviewer and yes both of us our videos on  they selected ppl from this round the second round online on zoom call with the codepair platform for dsa coding questions the first round surprisingly just mcqs which on wide array of stuff including english proficiency logical and reasoning puzzles c based questions like output  in the second round basics of oops and logic of some dsa questions  then there couple of os questions  later given real life problem  in the first round given simple

first rounds tricky for the rd along with questions from across dbms os oops and also c and c for me as them in my resume  interviews consisted of technical hr round the coding test consisted of general aptitude cs theory lot of java oops didn get most of and coding questions dp backtracking  apart from one question about my project the rest of the interview mostly behavioural questions  candidates who selected from gd went on for personal interview  st round group discussion topic do we need smart cities  at pm list posted on telegram group students selected  the final interview hr where the interviewer me whether used oracle products before java mysql netbeans ide and other usual hr questions like why oracle ? and why should we recruit you ?  java them in the resume  the next interview resume based where the interviewer went through my resume in detail me to explain the project most confident about and then told me to take as long as wanted to prepare and deliver minute presentation on c vs  since used to coding in c didn use any high level library functions but others who used c told to rewrite their code if they ended up using any  upon completion he me to explain and then another problem to code which solved by building upon the first problem  the first interview technical where the interviewer me to write code for problem on paper and me the liberty to take as long as wanted  the next three rounds all interviews which took place on march  divided into number of sections which included aptitude english and coding  the first round minute online test which took place on march  the following the procedure for the recruitment of second year interns oracle extended third year internship offer to all those who selected for its second year internship  on the whole the dsa questions weren hard at all  to write code for each functionality  off simple and got little complicated towards the end  the interviewers kept adding more and more functionalities to the question went on for about minutes  the last question to design data structure that met certain criteria list of functionalities that to performed in o amortized time  some questions based on dbms concepts never to write sql queries or anything like that the questions purely conceptual since told them dbms isn my strongest subject  few basic oops questions based on virtual tables and virtual pointers  very basic bfs question which also to code in the interviewers only me minute or so to code in since extremely simple  lots of os questions to give snippets of code as examples write code to create deadlock in system basic shell scripts and things like that  interview round taken by interviewers  st interview round about basic cs concepts and few questions based on my resume  only coding questions no aptitude questions online round wasn too hard anyone who does cp regularly wouldn find very difficult  my guess is that the hr round only check for fitment to the working environment rather than anything else  finally they told me that the role interviewed for based in hyderabad and whether willing to relocate for the internship because am from bangalore  they also me if any projects in the past because from my resume clearly visible that ve no prior experience with projects  they just me to introduce myself and me why wanted to work for qualcomm as opposed to any other

next he me if any projects before and since hadn he me to explain the concepts learnt in the online courses on machine learning these online courses what on my resume because hadn worked on any projects before  next he me some questions on basic computer architecture risc and cisc processors types of interrupts different interrupt routines  he me to code simple problem first  my interviewer by asking me to introduce myself and asking which area interested in  the second round technical interview  looking back wouldn have cleared the online test if not for leaving those questions unattempted because the test negative marking  being from an ece background wasn familiar with dbms or os related concepts so left all of those questions  in the software section the questions mostly based on dsa os dbms and oops  the coding section tested basic knowledge and understanding of c revising first year concepts thoroughly should enough for this  the general aptitude section tested your speed in easy high school mathematics  since applied for software profile attempted the software section  for the third section we an option of choosing between communication or digital for hardware or software  since the company offering both hardware and software profiles the first two sections general aptitude and coding common to both hardware and software profiles  the test sections each with questions and time limit of minutes for each section  the first round an online test the selection procedure consisted of total of rounds  rd round hr interview he just me some tips on how to effectively utilize the internship opportunity  in digital about counter using ff couldn answer this setup and hold time verilog coding  and then he moved on to communication bit surprised as applied for digital he me about plls modulation lna power amplifier basically he asking me about the communication concepts and then wanted me to arrive at the circuitry required for them  round interview the interviewer with my project he me the technical details after that like brainstorming session like what the applications of my project and what modifications required to implement practically  st round online test which comprised of sections namely coding aptitude and digital electronics we have to choose one between software communication and digital  the third round the hr interview  the

that as well  in oops they me mainly about virtual functions and virtual tables  they landed up asking me questions from every domain including dsa oops dbms and os  rounds of interview of hour each followed by hr round  in the second round around shortlisted  st round an online test of an aptitude section an oops related section some java based so landed up skipping them and coding problems  so basically the number of technical interviews depend on your performance in first technical interview  due to some reasons to attend hr round for formality sake the interesting thing intel came looking for other profile but basing on my skill and interest interviewer checked for vacancies in the profile liked and ended up placing me in that profile but there something interesting that happen to me declared selected in the first round itself for profile platform pnp engineer  technical interviews followed by hr round generally consists of stages  interview to know technical knowledge by asking

attempted the digital electronics part  the test consisted of three sections aptitude computer programming skills basically c programming and technical section of questions each with each section having time limit of minutes  online test an online test conducted on hirepro platform which video and audio proctored  cgpa reduced from for hardware and software internships  we just knew that the selection procedure would involve three rounds and cutoff of qualcomm didn conduct any pre recruitment talk  all those who made to this round selected for the internship  questions based on instrumentation amplifier rectifiers differentiators peak detector early effect in bjts latch to flip flop conversion  surprisingly most of the questions from analog itself  just that more into analog electronics than digital  questions based on digital electronics sequential counters fsms gate delays analog rlc bjts opamps and verilog snippets  st round online test  very much satisfied with this round of interview becoz all this went on pure communication  some basic networking concepts  half of the interview part on that project  have one more project from btech which is on wi fi  round they

representing functions with universal gates chain of inverters static cmos circuits sram some of the topics they focused on  several questions with various connections to g s terminals of mosfet  number of technical interviews depends on individual performance  other students shortlisted based on both cgpa and projects  resume shortlisting based on cgpa for vlsi students hr is cool and they will mainly about why intel and he about personality minutes  mostly he questions from that and he few programming questions from verilog and very basic questions from c language only few intervieuwee from c language minutes of interview technical digital from gate revise entire gate syllabus he many questions from basics have read from cmos vlsi from rabey in my case there rounds of interview the selection procedure went like this resume short lisiting cgpa spoc can negiotiate with company about cgpa resume shortlist telephonic interviewwritten test interview over callthere different panels for different department so there more than panels  both technical and hr rounds equally important  general compatibity questions also  more of two way conversation  the last round hr round  explain your resume in detail  the interview centered around the projects and internships in the resume  the second round technical round  the coding questions tested the basics  the test consisted of aspects

difficulty medium  round technical interview after first round people selected out  attempted digital analog physical design  they told to attempt like digital is mandatory and out of remaining four atleast one if you good in all sections you can attempt all you need to attempt round written test there sections digital analog verilog c language and physical design  in the second interview they focussed on digital design in detail verilog and projects in the resume  in the first interview they about my projects in resume cmos vlsi sta basics of digital electronics and programming question  they took two separate interviews for different profiles there is written test followed by technical interview followed by hr interviewfirst round shortlisting of the students based on resume for interviews the whole procedure with an online hackerrank assessment followed by technical round in which they one pattern printing problem and lastly an hr round in which behavioral type questions  from these students selected for an internship  round an ideathon at the microsoft campus day event where we judged based on our knowledge ideas and presentation skills  the selection for that as follows round online coding test consisted of around questions i codess intern at microsoft in my second year  sorry can remember much at this point they have conducted three rounds of interview without written test first round coding test  rd round an hr round with general questions  questions mostly related to the resume and general coding related ones  round technical interview held online  the second round is technical interview where they very basic technical questions and questions based on resumefirst round an online assessment test of logical questions english grammar related questions and coding questions related to dsa  they give two coding questions and couple of mcqs on general coding concepts like oops os dbms  totally there only rounds first round an online test  this also included the hr round for me  basic dsa questions and questions from your project  here if you get selected you would called for an interview which is round  this comparatively easier than the other companies  rd round hr st round is an online coding round  round technical interview resume based questions and puzzle  algorithms one floyd warshall and another using stack queue  coding straight forward brute force approach questions  programming sql and basic c output questions  english grammatical and vocabulary based questions  st round online test sections  hr round has no role in selection of candidate few questions about intel like its campuses in india and any location preference and other casual questions  some questions on metastability and cmos inverter characteristics and physical design cycle since from electrical background about two way switch and s working  questions mostly basic from sta setup time hold time and one timing violation question to on paper clock gating path questions digital electronics positive and negative unate for given gate based on inputs construction of and gate using cmos logic and to draw truth table followed by best and worst case delay for given input pin location state machine sequence detector projects to design hardware which used in my project  so will sum up my both technical interview experience  but with me due to some miscommunication among them my resume passed to more than one team yes some teams conducting interviews all from different domains mostly  quite formal round no technical questions  he informed what all teams came for interview  in this round about my area of interest  but there one panel in beginning where recruitment head segregating resumes based on individual interest during my time selection based on two rounds technical and h  interview will have or technical rounds and hr round no written test only interview  its good to have project relating to systems  interview pretty straightforward and interviewer mostly focused on my project  students selected for final interviews  for us round an elimination round due to time constraints by the company and we given real world problem  students selected for round  they pretty easy if you manage your time well  st round will an online test with main focus on aptitude and slight coding  two days after the interview names of the selected students announced  they shortlisted of us and that very day we our interviews  only after first round they contacted our cr to send in resumes of interested people for shortlisting internship wasn open for meta initially  in hr round me about my background my work experience and about intel  in the second technical round questions on vehicular networks point to point communication computer communication networks and error control coding  questions related to my project which on my resume  the first technical round on embedded systems in both hardware and software points of view  the interview has total of two technical rounds and an hr round there is no written test and shortlisted based on the resume  interview by asking favorite subject and later questions from all st semester basic topics like cmos testing and also digital circuits  st interview about basic computer architecture  if the first panel have interest in you he will call again as formality for second round if he doesn he will send you to other panel there technical rounds and one hr round  technical interview questions about some c coding snippets logical puzzles and also about computer architecture and memory management  there aptitude and baisc c coding questions  then we technical and hr interviewfor me there only round of interview and then hr round st round the online round on hirepro  gd for shortlisted students which passage writing followed by actual gd first round is written test mcqs  hr interview yes no type questions which took roughly min in tech interview questions on strings and

material sciences  the interview basically conversation and the interviewer expects us to know basics of good engineering practices and methodologies  the second round personal interview for the shortlisted students based on the first round  fair percentage of the technical questions related to turbomachines  the first round basic online test which consisted of technical aptitude and reasoning questions  why did you choose mechanical engineering ? you flexible ? why intel ? what is your weakness ? what is your strength ? you good at decision making ? in which field would you like to work ? what if give you some other field to work with ?the selection procedure rounds tech in mechanical engineering  hr interview tell me about yourself ? why did you choose software field after doing b  which data structure is best for sorting operation ? which data structure is best for searching and why ? tell me about heap sort ? expecting questions from oops concept and operating system but they did not any question from these two  first technical interview what all subjects have you studied here ? what else have you studied in data structure ? what the advantages of array ? what is heap ? how do we use heap ? what is binary tree ? so you have your project in machine learning what is machine learning ? there two trains starting from two points moving towards each other one with velocity km h one with velocity km h they meet at point tell me which train will reach the point first ? second technical interview he me about my project in detail long discussion  but will write the questions in the three interviews and leave the conclusion part up to the reader  want to make any conclusion about the interview since feel that gonna help the reader there two technical rounds and an hr round after this they announced the result  round will interview type where technical as well as hr questions  keep in mind that this test is very imporatnt because most of shortlisted candidates from test got selected technical interview basics of os and brain teaserson filling the form on iris they will shortlist the candidate after that st round test which will have aptitude type and mechanical questions  finally students selected and offered internship  this round lasted for about mins  another question how many days will take to learn new language  normal hr questions like why should we hire you and what special abilities do you bring to the table  hr round here too to explain my projects but after that completely non technical  six members selected for the next round

going to this assignment ? ?  for the second round they us an assignment to complete within one day  after first round total students selected for the second round  one of them of easy level and another one of medium level there two problems of graph first round an online coding round  then he me to write pseudo codes for all of them on paper and some other dsa questions  round not that hard questions on different sorting algorithms their advantages disadvantages use cases  remember one question to detect cycle in graph rd round interview this the last round off with tell me about yourself ?  explain the solution properly and answer all their queries by iterating over your code  here also they expect you to write code in c c but took permission to write in python so better you know c beforehand  if you use python just brush up your java or c skills and to attempt all questions solving will get you to next round round group fly we called in group of and to medium level dsa questions with code on paper  questions pretty simple question based on trees but there language constraint only c c and java allowed  st round three dsa questions out of which able to two  so completed one pre test first milestone and some portion of second milestone  there milestone for problem and we have almost hr to implement  so in this we have to create web service using restapi flask python framework for doing  parallelly there interview going on like how much you have understand the problem which language you using and what your approach to  bridge edge in graph after first round company us assignment to do in time period first round coding round there two graph problems hr round pretty much formality they described the internship duration and compensation apart from that they also me project related questions like what all issues faced and such managerial round also bit of coding logic type questions and puzzle concepts related to pointers and dynamic memory

personal interview pressure interview wherein both the technical and the hr panelists tried to put pressure and get an impulsive response for minutes  rd round holland code test personal interview the holland code test is psychometric test used to classify your personality  the shortlist for the next round based on the overall performance  the judges looked at the process rather than the final solution  the objective to discuss and work as team and the puzzle  here we divided into groups of and presented with common puzzle along with unique clue cards each  st round online test consisted of sections logical reasoning basic maths technical round discussion based problem solving this welcome change from the traditional gd shortlisted students selected based on overall performance shortlisted students have to appear for group discussion and passage writing which is followed by technical and hr interview  hr roundfirst round is written test which has mcq questions for scholastic aptitude and language proficiency  the second round involved pure dsa questions and this round really hard questionsthere four rounds in selection procedure  for me the first round involved dsa questions on topics that would needed by the company to optimize storage and time  the number of levels of interviews for the selected students varied  the difficulty level of this test wasn too high or too low  next hr interview in which the interviewer me my interests hobbies and about co curricular activitiesthe selection procedure involved regular online coding test next round technical interview in which they me about my previous projects my work in iris and some questions related to nodejs and mysql  both questions of dynamic programming and time allotted hours first round online test in which questions  five people offered an internship after this round  general hr questions also like what your strengths and weaknesses along with what you have to strengthen them  almost all the technical questions that in the pi related to the things put up in my cv  the interviewers technical questions about the internships and projects that in my resume  rd round the personal interview as the name suggests mix of both the technical as well as hr in comparison to the traditional companies  around people selected after gi  we to collect our thoughts and give the most practically suitable solution along with walk through our thought process aloud group discussion on different solutions provided  in this particular section of the selection procedure the company focuses on analytical skills in addition to communication skills by giving real life problem faced by the company  round this round is called the group interview round is nothing but modified gd  for us around candidates  after the st round the list of shortlisted candidates released  the first round relatively quite predictable and easier than core coding companies  st round this based on generic aptitude questions along with some basic coding questions from oops object oriented programming system and sql structured query language along with timed section containing two dynamic programming questions  some questions about verilog and some basic sta questions and basics of digital  then in the skype interview hr duration interviewer basic questions about vlsi design  in hardware part questions

conducted in amcat test portal  students selected among the students who shortlisted for the interview  the best part that the ceo took my interview  some rounds of interview while some only one  one online assessment round where you have to answer questions based on the ongoing projects at their firm  typical hr questions askedtelephonic interviewidkselection pretty straightforward  the rd wound an hr round  round consisted of technical interview questions based on the projects in my resume  st round pen and paper test questions on logical reasoning math and programming  few questions based on c programming also  they looking for embedded profile interview mainly consisted of questions related to b tech project first shortlisted based on resume and then telephonic interview but heard two or three students from pes got eliminatted in the interview once you got shortlisted you will get for sure from mechatronics no one got eliminated in this interview then they about pid controller basics of c what is difference between array and structure where array is used so first they sorted electrical students and then selected for interview based on cgpa round telephonic interview questions related to projects in the resume  from mechatronics they needed students having btech eee background  purely based on cgpa  st round resume shortlisting  the questions as follows first basic oop questions iterative inorder traversal b second two questions which solved using circular queue and min heap respectively  interview rounds technical interviews followed by hr interview  we to write the code on paper and to well commented  find an element k in spirally sorted matrix  group fly round around students made to sit room and to come up with the most efficient solution of the following problem  they data structure based rather than pure cp  the difficulty not very high and the questions very solvable  the unfair part that every student got different set of questions  coding test there an online coding test where we to questions  other questions covered operating systems and moderate level dsa problemthere major rounds they as follows  round personal interview about my projects the algorithms used and the technologies used  we to write the code for  st round group fly round with two easy to moderate level questions  technical roundsonline test the difficulty moderate and the time sufficient to able to all of them  the last round an hr round where they me general questions about myself and also compatibility questions  they did focus lot on the projects in the resume and made sure complete knowledge about the working and the theory behind the projects in my resume  the round technical interview where few dsa dbms and resume based questions the st round an online coding round of coding questions and few logical reasoning and aptitude based questions  finally of us selected  then he shifted to my resume and about my projects  my guy me

oriented programming  cannot stress enough on how important is to explain your thought process and how you arrived at the solution to the interviewer  this relatively easier as come across this problem before  my second round also surprisingly dsa based where one question on arrays  practice writing pseudo code as will necessary  took while to but arrived at the optimum solution  round interviews my first round technical interview where they me only one dsa question on strings  add comments to your program and make look neat and readable  remember to think out loud and discuss your approach with the mentor assigned to you  this is to test if we can write good code without repeatedly testing and then debugging  one question will given and we re expected to write the code correctly on paper  round group fly this is just fancy term for simple pen and paper coding test  always remember to visit all questions and to not spend too much time on one question round online

online test  then few hr questions  the technical questions little tougher trees and dp  linked lists trees the second round technical hr  the first round is purely technical very basic questions  after the shortlist released we interviews the first round an online round with coding and aptitude questions  finally received the offer for the internship  the round concluded within half an hour  then one os one dbms and one daa question which able to answer  the interview off about my hobbies then he went through my resume and me deep questions about my projects and internship  the third round hr interview with another samsung r interviewer  around students shortlisted for the third and final round scheduled on the same day  the round lasted for about an hour or two  after this one on one interview taken by the interviewer assigned to us who about the approach to the question and optimisations if possible  each group made to sit in room with samsung r employee interviewer who two questions of easy medium difficulty and the solution to written on sheets  the second round group fly round where students split into groups of  around students shortlisted for the second round  solved completely and partially  we given questions of varying difficulty to do the first round coding test on the cocubes platform  ended up with chit chat session  is the best time to get familiar with the company and hesitate to questions  hr very friendly and me detailed explanation of what the company does and makes an impact globally  to explain few of the projects thoroughly  rd round hr interview though an hr round tricky oops questions along with the technologies and tools that on my resume  candidates selected for the hr round  ended up with me giving complete walkthrough of one of my projects  the interviewer friendly and helped me to figure out the solution to write the code for the same on paper and to suggest an alternative solution  one question of medium hard difficulty on strings  rd technical interview minutes oops concepts like inheritance access modifiers and polymorphism  for other guys dp and medium level dsa questions  the interviewer kept on digging deep inside the project and finally impressed and satisfied  technical interview minutes long discussion on one of my projects with the interviewer  few questions about my interests  then interviewer scanned my resume thoroughly and to design the database schema for one my project org detect cycle in graph nearly people selected after this round round technical interviews st technical interview minutes easy medium level dsa questions to write code for each question  st round online round divided into sections and conducted over hackerrank aptitude and logical reasoning ii programming concepts questions on os oops and c programming iii coding question there problem statement which then boiled down to this question https www  the fourth round hr round in which she me about location preference and why jp ? like questions  third round also technical interview in which have to write pseudocode of bubble sort and binary search after that to draw balanced bst on whiteboard and then they give me tables and have to write query to get the required output using join operation and then he instructed me to tower of hanoi problem  round two technical interview in which they about my projects and me to design snake game in cpp after that there lots of questions about operating systems and at the end they me pascal triangle to code the first round coding round in which codes there one printing matrix spirally of marks and another one sort of josephus type problem with negative cycles also of marks  round basic dsa question and to explain every corner of resume  people shortlisted after this round  questions based on various functionalities of web browser  think priority queue avl tree stacks dequeues doubly linked lists  brush up on all the data structures and time complexity of each operation in such structures  round system design data structures question  about people got shortlisted after this round  st round online round with close to mcq questions to solved in minutes in the areas of english puzzles coding and general software engineering  explained them method but they me to make my algorithm more efficient which able to do and the last question  question coding given string write efficient code to count the frequency of each character in that string  but not able to find the exact solution and as they getting late they just new question  they even encouraged me that going in the right direction but missing at one point  so can you tell how much km can car run if each wheel can for max km ? going in the correct direction but my calculation little bit wrong  question puzzle suppose there is car having four new wheels and one stepney which is having new wheel too  they satisfied with my solution  they asking me to tell the time and space complexity of all my algorithms  solved my question using or and xor operator which taking the same time complexity as before but space complexity drastically decreased  then remind what can the hint actually before starting the question they whether know operators or not and this hint itself  then after sometime they told that they already given some hint while conversation only  did that but my solution not optimized they me to optimize more  questions given number can you write code in your favorite language which swaps adjacent nibble four bits consecutively  then they came to the main questions they me questions  they me about who is my favorite cricketer ms dhoni and whether am bowler or all rounder or batsmen some other questions regarding cricket  as that love cricket and captained when playing for the district from my school  spoke about minutes as soon as electricity came back they start asking me question about dsa and puzzle question  thought this is the time where can make an impact by telling about all my projects and other things  they first me to introduce myself but in the meantime the electricity went off as the weather not good at that time raining heavily  round technical two interviewers taking this round  this interview about minutes long  then he told me to careful about my answers and told me to wait for some time so further which shows that he satisfied with my interview  after this answer he appreciated me but still he not that much satisfied and one question that might have given some interviews before then why cisco but here comes the twist before he me this question complete just replied in middle that this is my first company which applied which lie and interested in cisco then he countered me telling that this shows that you have been following for quite long which replied yes lie then he me to tell the name of ceo of cisco wick robbins which not able to tell  so as there is one more year before will join cisco so can learn that also  then again countered him that as before one year know anything about ai ml dl but now know very well and did an internship in iisc and one work from home internship also during same summer  he then told me that though cisco is working in ai ml dl but his department is not working in ai  replied to him by countering that as attended the ppt in that morning all the spokesperson telling that cisco is working in the field of ai ml dl then why you telling that cisco is not working in this field and you not interested in me  so being calm at that time counter questioned him which he not able to give the exact answer which he wanted to give and just changed the topic and trying to catch me in further conversation  thought that this just question to irritate me to check my patience level or to see how will respond in pressure situation but am so much passionate about ai cannot handle situation who speaks against ai  he even told that will waste of my time as well as their money if cisco will hire me  the manager saw my resume and making some weird faces and told that his department currently not working in ai ml dl or fields which in my resume and tough one that why should hire you if my department is not working in your area of interest  round managerial this little tough round for me because told lie in this round which one of the biggest blunder by me though selected god saved me  then she me all the above question  because since lot of projects in ml so myself spoke about minutes telling about projects and she also why this algorithm why not others and so on  the time period of this round around minutes  since used binary search in my solution she also me to write the code of binary search in my favorite language and then she me questions related to complexity theory and then also me to write the code for quick sort where struggled sometimes but she very helpful even she explained to me the whole concept of quicksort with an example although know theoretically  question coding given an array which is sorted but rotated some number of times and number write an efficient code which will tell whether that number is part of that array or not  question coding given number write function to tell whether that number is the power of or not and told to write the code in c not in python which easily explained her  then she me that at least know the basics of programming and then she me two questions  then also told her that do cp much  told her the truth that am machine learning enthusiast so she can anything in python ml dl but know only basics of c and never worked in c and know java too round technical she me to introduce myself and tell about me  then some oops and database questions and some backend as well  questions on my projects and resume  rd round hr technical round  question on dijkstra in matrix  in round we to code the solution on paper and discuss approach with mentors present  on bfs in matrix one involved dfs

round hr me if am comfortable with any location and any profile  this comparatively difficult round since surprised me how deeply he about arm cores and risc v processor which simply read for other purposes which came in handy  then they me about sta then how to meet the timing requirement between two flip flops  then he me about data structures and some python functions  then they me to explain about cache and caching techniques  he very interested in my project that doing at maxlinear internship working on microprocessors only  round technical round they me about my mobile processor and he told me to explain the architecture and microarchitecture of arm cores  some gate level design questions eg consider black box which will have bit p and bit o p and there is register in black box which will accumulate the values coming from p terminal to lsb of register and we need to check the value stored in the register is even or not if even o p bit should high once answered this question he me to draw similar gate design to check whether the number accumulated is multiple of or not  then they me to draw p and gate and me about the basics of cmos transistors sizing and parasitic capacitors  then they me about the projects that have basics of c programming oops concepts and efficient way to check number is prime or not  opt for digital round technical interview most of the questions based on my resume and internship project round online test of aptitude basic c programming and communication or digital electronics section  finally hr round  also couple of brainteasers  two technical interviews based on dsa oops projects and previous internships  coding round with questions  then discussion about microsoft with the interviewer  this question can solved using graphs where each vegetable can considered node and vegetables touching each other can have an edge  find the minimum time in which all the vegetables become rotten  also provided the pair of vegetable id s which touches each other one rotten vegetable can make some fresh vegetable touching rotten in one hour assume fresh vegetable only becomes either rotten or fresh not partially rotten  question there n vegetables numbered from n some of them rotten which given in an array  for some time got stuck and really hard then him an approach and method to the problem apart from brute force to which he not able to understand through phone call as hard to imagine the working of the algorithm without pen and paper although the interviewer really kind and told me that he is going to give some alternate problem  given two numbers x and y find the number of numbers between x and y both inclusive which have exactly set bits in their binary representation  question first about binary representation and stuff then proceeded  the time complexity remains the same but space can further reduced here  then what if you can read each number multiple times  after for some time for hint and then reduced space solution  got dp solution which correct then to optimize space in my solution  find if the matrix can said as valid sudoku or not given that you can read each number only once  question given matrix of size representing sudoku puzzle fully filled with integers between  explain which sorting algorithm should used and why and how the algorithm would work ? able to get an approach to the problem which very much near to what the interviewer wanted but then changed my approach to which the interviewer told me that earlier on the right path for some time able to get the solution  question given primary memory of size mb secondary memory which can assumed large enough file of size mb of integers sort the integers and put the sorted list in new file  to and explain the logic to the interviewer through the phone call  then the interview proceeded to pure dsa based interview  the interviewer first me why do you want to join microsoft for an internship  technical interview expecting face to face interview but there lot of candidates so told to give telephonic interview  what if we need heap of size at most k ? then if any other projects apart from what in my resume to which replied no  question code max heap  question easy to think only one should also consider the case for negative difference  question given linked list where each node has an integer between as data and the complete linked list denotes some given number eg is then subtract one number from another  then dsa questions given and to implement the working code on paper org search element in spirally sorted matrix technical interview first the interviewer viewed my resume and questioned about one of the projects based on machine learning how implemented the logic behind the implementation assumptions made  question given matrix sorted in spiral order ascending and some value x find if exists or not link https www  this round time constraints of one hour in total  we to dsa question and write the working code on paper then explain the approach used in the solution and show how one implemented the code whether the solution of desired complexity or not  group of made and each group assigned one interviewer  group fly round around students shortlisted for this round  could get correct and partially correct  technical hrcoding round questions dsa based of easy moderate difficulty given coding round technical rounds hr manger s review also will considered will having coding test and interviews  work on your presentation and communication skills  based on your contribution to visa through your work and the way you answer their questions they take the ppo decision  in the last week of internship you have to give presentation on your project to the leadership panel  after getting internship work hard for those three months interact with as many people as possible to increase your knowledge about the company and then decide if you like the work or not and if you want to continue at the same company  there only one interview round in which they technical questions from dsa to they give enough time to think so panic and hr based questions  shortlisted students proceed for interviews  the coding round they coding questions the selection procedure for getting internship in visa has two rounds  then there three interview rounds two technical and one hr  the next round

apart from aptitude basics of digital electronics and digital signal processing the first round screening test  the second round the hr round with few dbms questions  the main focus of this round dsa oops and dbms concepts and few logical puzzles  the first round technical interview round  there rounds of interviews during the last week of the internship period  that s !the ppo selection process took place in the company itself and thus no coding round  there min qna session after presentation basic aptitude followed by an hr interviewi to present my project in front of managers and director  the questions very very basic  did have ppo interview while interning there  the placement procedure is also quite similar  you can read my internship gyan for internship procedure  since offered ppo didn go through the placement process at all i interned at the same company in the summer of my third year  if he is impressed you will selected and there no hr roundfirst round online aptitude test and second round technical interview  conducted in groups where the interviewer comes to us for the explanation  round technical where they to write an algorithm for designing tic tac toe game  st round online test with more aptitude questions and little coding questions  for feedback and proactive  have intellectual honesty for help when you need  ppo sincerely work for your project maintain good relations with your mentor and manager  interview has mix of technical and general aptitude questions  if your hiring manager gives positive feedback based on work then direct hire else interview

questions bit higher than the st round  no actual programming on system involved  we mainly required to explain our solution approach to the recruiters and write pseudo code on sheet of paper  the bunch of students who qualified st round split into groups of and each group given dsa questions  second round consisted of group fly round  the level of questions average and pretty standard  first round consisted of coding test there total of rounds  just an observation could wrong also  but the candidates whose first round late their second round delayed by huge amount of time  after my first round they called my for the second round in minutes  they will in pretty chill mode than after taking interviews read this somewhere else think on glassdoor this think helped  the reason is the interviewers will really fresh frustration less calm at the beginning  wanted to in the first  then they called for candidates  just before the interview rounds about to begin we to fill in form  this is an observation might have helped me  they will probably appreciate your frankness  if you only think you could have better clearly identify those points and tell  if they you back how you felt again frank  they will more than happy to give you constructive feedback  also make sure you how the interview any feedback suggestions  make sure you have left some kind of an impression on them  and talk to them for while  read about what the company does is doing cutting edge  at the end of every interview they if any questions  from there could figure out the thing  then he himself small clue  told know what he asking  this happened with me also  every moment with the interviewer is an oppurtunity to prove something  that is the time you should show how you manage panic situations  but if you know or not able to think about at that moment panic  is mostly about you getting the question  never think in negative manner oh what happens if question during the interview  you can definitely confident !  even if you nervous hold  when you see the interviewer give him her firm handshake and wish good morning afternoon something  dont lie ! if they catch you is mostly sure that you will

told the truth  she hr lady why wanted to join cisco  round pseudo interview this is pseudo round because only for minutes  after hour they called me in for hr interview  while designing he also tested how patient am how well argue to prove my point  true that me and my friend wanted to design thread library  they really sharp and will catch you at any point and questions related to  lesson is careful and aware of what you tell to the interviewers  he me sheet and to design for him  we talking and just told my friend and me planning to write thread library but that project never took off  frank with him and told the reasons  the first question he why my cgpa less  this round mix of hr technical questions  round interview after hour or so called for round  write code means writing fully functional readable code including error handling  he cared most about my coding style if error handling properly or not  then to write program for  he never discouraged that did not get the best solution  the interviewer really encouraging and always if we can do better  did not get the best solution in the first go  there programming question for which to design the solution first and write code for on paper  later all questions on c basic oop concepts like classes  frank with him and said that used c only for stl and did not know oop properly  he oop questions but did not know oop properly  told am confortable with c c  they tested my hold on programming languages computer networks dsa  round interview minutes after interview they called me for the second one  if you have put systems programming then he might anything related to like what system call is ? what interrupts  if you have put something in your resume then know every detail related to  s ok if you have not much  put things which you have not  there important things here  the interviewer went through my resume thoroughly and asking questions about every line in my resume  the complete interview based on my resume  this round the first interview round minutes  round interview no  because aptitude is easy but time consuming  on advantage you get if you practice aptitude questions is that you will get more

if project is allocated to you which is not in your area of interest st round online coding round on hackerrank round detailed interview on one of my project and questions related to data structures used  some puzzle related questions  me to explain some of my projects  questions like explain mtu ssh client is trying to connect to ssh server but server doesn respond what could the possible reasons draw tcp or ip header how can we reduce latency in network what happens when we connect an optic fiber cable to server about ethernet cable what is vlan what is rpf protocol used in mobile where we connect the charger first round online test coding questions aptitude technical reasoning second round technical interview focused mostly on my resume and discussed each and every project written in my resume in detail third round technical interview mainly networking related questions as my area of interest networking and the interviewer also from networking background  after this selection results declared  the second round an interview round questions based on my projects digital electronics and aptitude there two rounds the first required the resume to uploaded based on this the first round of selection there group discussion which followed by technical interview round  hr cheerful person and got in minutes  what like and who am  round hr round just about me  for ex when you will use counting and binary semaphores  if he got satisfied with your optimization he some operating system questions and there real world use cases  after that he for optimizing the code  told us to write the code  he giving one coding question  round interview in this round the interviewer predetermined to reject lot of candidates so that they can match the requirement  some programming question based on bit logic also  overall the interview went for hour  after this he discussed the project doing  like way tcp handshake function pointers use cases semaphores union and classes  the interviewer me various question based on c and networking  round written test with aptitude and c questions  we rounds of interview plus screening round  the internship duration of months i got an internship in cisco through campus and then got the ppo in the same  second round being the interview where the panelists make sure they re taking the right people in for getting their work  st round mcqs most of them probability based and aptitude questions round resume based interviewfirst round screening test fairly easy and won hard to clear the test with the right amount of preparation  all the interviews only one interviewer  why qualcomm ? what your strengths and weaknesses ? some of the questions  hr interview this interview just minutes long  not much on my resume  some aptitude questions which bit confusing but interesting  design of fsms static timing analysis risc and cisc processors the main topics  they mainly tested our knowledge in digital electronics analytical and problem solving skills  both of around minutes  technical interviews there rounds  wrong answers carried negative marks  some advanced questions on risc and cisc processors also  questions based on second year ece courses like deca dsd analog electronics microprocessors  chose electronics in the hardware section  general aptitude and programming aptitude sections similar to those of most of the companies  the people who chose hardware profile to choose one of electronics or communication  if we chose both they could assign us any profile based on our performance in the test  there choices in the profile related section software or hardware or both  online test consisted of three parts general aptitude c programming aptitude and profile related section  at last smile and confident shake hand  explained him relating the previous experience and how would handle things  then me why fidelity what would do for the company ?  then about previous experience in jio quikr and difficulties faced there and how over came and then about how manage time as held different positions of responsibility  followed by introduction about myself again about being mining engineering student why cs ?  overall around mins round hr round initially confident shake hand with the interviewer first impression is the best impression  confident enough in answering all questions which the interviewer liked and me to wait for the next round  following which he some basics of sql queries about my projects programming languages frameworks known and previous experience training  then me why am interested in computer science when from mining engineering explained him about the passion and love for cs brought in by cs teacher at grade  st round technical the interviewer me about myself and go through my resume  out of around students who wrote the test students got shortlisted for the first round of interview  the consisted of sections english literature data structure algorithm mcqs programming questions the test easy enough did well in all sections and solved competitive programming problem and the other partially ran out of time online test hosted on fidelity based platform  interview questions on basic c coding data structures probability aptitude and projects  five rounds of interview the number of rounds differ for each candidate  online test which included aptitude mcq and coding related questions code writing question mcqs there no pointer cut off for the test first round online coding round which also aptitude  st round online test containing mcq s on aptitude logical reasoning technical questions on data structures oops round common question given to the shortlisted candidates that is to write an algorithm to find the best possible move computer could make in an n x n tic tac toe so that the probability of computer winning is maximum  hr interview regular hr stuff  basic digital electronics questions and resume based questions  personal interview shortlisted people called for pi  hardware section has all the basic electronics questions learnt until year  and the rd is based on your interest software hardware or communication  first section is aptitude  and each section has time limit  online test online test will have three sections  there three phases in qualcomm s selection process  ll describe the process went through to get the internship i offered ppo from qualcomm in august  the candidate can also questions regarding their projects in their cv the screening test will consist of basic electronics and coding questions along with good amount of aptitude question the second round is for the shortlisted candidates the question will mainly based on analog and digital electronics the selection procedure involves screening test followed by short technical interview  few questions on my resume areas of interest  hr interview nothing specific  then finally one trees question that is to print the left view of binary tree  some basic oops related questions  then to write the code for infix to postfix conversion  technical interview some questions on dsa like rotating liked list detection of loop in linked list  there sectional cutoff so attempting each section must  c apti java networking os and general aptitude  online test this on mettl platform  the first round technical that involved round of questions regarding my project and the second hr round  after clearing that the personnel of the company conduct two rounds of interview  st round coding round pen and paper coding rd round interview resultsfirstly an online test conducted that comprised of quantitative aptitude english proficiency and coding questions  some of my friends also to sell pen in yes you guessed shuddh hindi  in the end they wanted to know how you different from the rest in shuddh hindi  not that cannot speak hindi but not at all prepared for this  the questions very philosophical and having to answer those in hindi made even more difficult  third round stress interview this interview conducted in pure hindi which caught me off guard  this round went on for about hr for me  also to sell water bottle  they will figure out  there constantly looking for inconsistencies so make sure that you do not lie about anything  this conducted by some very senior executives from the company who very smart about  second round personal interview this more of an hr interview where they trying to get to know the candidate  the gd went on for about min  there two examiners in the room who observing everyone  we divided into groups on for the gd  the topics for gd the same as those given in other colleges that the company been to  second round group discussion  sometimes you cannot come back to section after going to the next  not only before the test but also during the test when switching between sections first round aptitude test read all the instructions very carefully  for me the rounds mostly technical which included questions on dsa linked lists stacks and queues mostly some rounds also focused on math questions based on probability and permutation and combinations  depending on your answers in various fields the further rounds test you based on the field you give most correct answers in  st round an online assesment round where the test comprised of basic programming language and mental ability later we technical and hr round in personthe process of interviews took one day which seven rounds for me coding test followed by one round of interview  questions also based on projects in the resume  round technical cum hr round dsa and logical questions  round group fly groups of formed and each group assigned different problem for which code has to written on paper  there three coding questions for min round coding test this coding round held on cocubes questions based on data structures and algorithms questions based on technologies and languages worked with also  apart from the resume other questions on logical reasoning probability theory and applications of data analysis to electronics  line by line questions on resume  round interview interview totally based on resume  english comprehension and aptitude part comparatively easy  good knowledge of statistics necessary  st round online test test on aptitude questions and statistics they me about my other projects also  they me about my project during codess and linked with the dsa and daa questions  hr cum technical interview  so directly got call for interview  but then in year participated in codess program round online coding round questions  the fourth round again technical interview round which questions on computer architecture operating system and convolutional neural networks this one based on the area of interest  then one question on implementing dictionary and another on string compression  the interviewer questions about my projects on the resume  the third round interview round  the second round group fly round which comprised of two questions one on trees and the other string manipulation  the questions pretty simple based on linked lists and string manipulation written round aptitude questions and basic c language problem personal interview behavioralthe first round online coding round which questions and the test duration mins  the final round the hr round where you more about yourself and your speaking skills and other aspects tested  second round problem solving sort of questions where challenges would thrown at you and you to them which included data structures operating systems  the shortlisted students called for further rounds which basically two technical interview rounds where the first round basically the officials skimming through your resume and getting to know about your projects and interests based on which second round would focus on your interests  we to few coding questions and some aptitude questions the selection process comprised of rounds where the first one coding challenge for one hour  second round group fly and the third round interview first round an online coding test  some people another hr round too  she few other questions on data science and banking related stuff and some behavioral questions too  interview the interviewer very friendly and me questions about my resume and projects  the questions apparently pretty easy so brushing up your stat basics before the test would probably helpful  stat bunch of questions on regression correlation and other stuff which couldn make head or tail of because hadn prepared any basic statistics before the test  the mathematics part mostly based on probability and some general math  online test comprehension grammar mathematics logical reasoning and statistics  the wait is hard but worth in the end  the entire procedure of interviews lasted from morning to evening  no technical details and just to make sure that knew what  also to explain my second year internship project since on my resume  chill and just felt like normal conversation  the final round an hr interview where questions like what keeps me motivated ? what my interests ?  there two questions which tested my conceptual understanding at that time where he explained something to me and me questions based on that  the interviewer very patient and he made sure that after every question there friendly conversation to make me feel less nervous  after clearing the written test there technical interview where mostly questions on my interest digital electronics  to clear this test fundamentals should clear and revision of relevant third semester and fourth semester courses will help  there no negative marking  all the questions analog digital and network analysis based  st sound coding round on paper code test where only the logic to explained with brief explananionthe first round for samsung semiconductors hardware written test which sections each of which questions with different weightages of marks  technical round practical questions based on os and algorithms  technical round discussion about projects and some basic questions on dsa online test two technical interviews hr interview online test questions based on data structures and algorithms  st round an online test based on aptitude basic c questions like finding errors or outputs and some basic electronics stuff more of digital electronics and microprocessors round an interview which would just test your confidence and tested on basic digital electronics like universal gates and static time analysis  third round hr round  they about what projects you worked on and expect you to have good knowledge about these projects  they mainly questions about your resume  second round the interview  basic english will sufficient  the coding questions not too hard  this round is very easy and basic knowledge of dsa will sufficient  sections logical maths technical english and coding round the first round an online test  as got recommendation from one of my mentors from this programme selected for the interviews directly and other rounds skipped  we got mentors from microsoft team who helped us throughout  in this program we to convert an idea into an app  participated in microsoft program in the summer in which selected through coding test  after that there would series of interviews first round is coding and next one is group fly round  the hr questions based on your coding habits and obviously why do you want to visa  the technical questions based of your past projects data structures algorithms object oriented programming and networking  the interviewer both technical as well as hr questions  questions of graph theory dynamic programming and hashing the coding round consisted of questions the first round coding round  some people myself included subsequent hr interview as well which more or less the same as the first one  interview very random can literally anything beneficial if one has background in data analysis or statistics  online test comprehension grammar logical reasoning mathematics mostly probability and statistics basic regression and correlation and basics  hr round in length about the contents of my resume other than which pretty straightforward interview  stuff on the amalgamation of two or more of the above topics such as static discharge electrically driven rotors  technical round questions in my field of interest namely aerodynamics aerospace and core electrical  bunch of questions on supercapacitors that couldn make head or tail of  technical short but tough  aptitude lengthy but easy  written test aptitude and technical parts  based on your performance you can have more than one round of interviews  questions will basic and the the interviewer will help if you get stuck any of the questions  in the interviews you will questions based on the profile  then you will have interviews for each profile  you could shortlisted in multiple profiles  based on your performance in each section of the test you shortlisted for either analog profile digital profile or software profile  chosen hardware profile so my online test contains the following sections analog electronics digital electronics and aptitude firstly there an online test of three sections based which profile you chose hardware software or hardware software

they checked on your confidence and speaking skills  hr round this chill where questions such as what your interests what motivates you  questions from fsm and static timing analysis at the end  technical round after being shortlisted there the technical round where the interviewer with basic digital problems on flip flops and counters and went on raising the bar of difficulty  also different sections of mark marks and marks for which time management important  more on digital based  online test consisted of mcq s from opamp s mux microprocessors mosfets cmos logic there rounds of selection online test technical and hr  some project related questions also  general hr questions and questions related to ds algo and some mathematical puzzles  round this the last round hr tech round  people selected from round to write the code and logic on paper to the given dsa problem and those who did and explained well called for the next round  python not allowed round this group fly

given questions and to write code time and space complexity  round on paper coding round  first on string second on binary tree third on binary search tree  st round online coding round on cocubes  general questions related to oops and puzzles and some dsa questions  round this the last round and again technical round  people to code on paper given the dsa problem and those who coded and explained forwarded to the next round the time limit for this round mins  round this pen paper round  the questions from data structures and algorithms  st round an online coding round where questions given and time given mins  questions about the kind of work you can do the technologies you comfortable with and the work you want to do  the third and the final round hr round  questions based on basic data structures and algorithms questions based on project in your resume the main focus  the first round of interview technical  the first round the preliminary selection test followed by two rounds of interview  then there regular hr questionsround written test of digital analog and aptitute questions round personal interview round advanced interview round hrthe entire selection process rounds  there questions like how would you explain to layman  and rd round hr  then to brief about my projects on the resume  they questions based on dsa and c the first round technical this round indeed stressful one  questions directed based on my resume followed by case study the interviewer apparently happen to the vp  the final round the hr interview for which shortlisted i case study puzzles and guesstimate question and few questions based on my resume as well  shortlisted for the technical interview round during the second half each and every one of us to switch to what stand we chose for in the beginning and then to conclude individually  the second the gd topics general and not debatable tech who wrote the test shortlisted for the second round the questions basic and of the students b  the first round being the aptitude round on cocubes platform there four rounds in total  finally they selected members  hr round hr mam me about my family background and some basic

questions min marks  written test there four sections  second round interview based on your resume some problem solving skills and oops concepts  thorough with your os concepts as most companies stress lot on os and can deciding factor to your selectionfirst round competitive coding is being tested in the first round  in the technical rounds they me about my projects questions related to my field of interest dbms basics and operating systems  there technical interview rounds and hr round  st round online test round hr cum technical interviewfirst round an online coding round  round but few  round didn have h  round all those who qualified st round of interview then called for round of technical interview wherein they similar type of questions as in round of technical interview but in depth  in digital they will cover almost every topic from counters registers to state machines and their practical applications brushing up with microprocessors basics will help  in analog they will basically test your basics on rlc ckts mosfet s bjt s signal processing and filters  round based upon my score of round called for interview for analog as well as digital profile both technical interviews  based upon your score in analog and digital they will then call you for interviews for respective profiles  questions not too hard but tricky spend too much time on any one question your aim should to maximum number of questions  other than hardware there more profiles software minutes test and hardware software profile minutes test it hr test they alloted minutes for analog digital and minutes for aptitude  the hardware profile test sections analog digital aptitude questions each  test only for hardware profile round will an online mcq based test  the first round group discussion on the basis of which students shortlisted for the interview round the procedure consisted of two rounds  after that round the final hr round  the topics given randomly and seconds of preparation time provided  after getting shortlisted the second round just minute session candidates to speak on topic for minute  did not contain programming questions  st round general apptitude round advance apptitude and programming mcq s technical round with situational questions and puzzelsthe first round of selection an online test of sections such as english grammar comprehension math and logical ability  round hr roundonline coding test on cocubes platform  round technical managerial round questions based on oops os round online test aptitude technical os data structures oops round technical round thorough with all the projects written in the resume questions based on algorithms and data structures there also puzzle questions which have to using math questions in the interviews mostly based on arrays trees and optimizing the code mcqs mostly consisted of probabilty and permutations based questions mixed with data structures and ml section online test coding question and mcqs online test followed by rounds of tech puzzle interviews and hr round they me to explain the algorithm as well as write the code for the techincal questions techincal questions will mostly from dsa a few questions based on my resume projects  round techincal and hr round both conducted in the same round  round programming and aptitude included maths too based multi choice questions two rounds held for interns  the next round basically like hr round where they they me my interests and why chose ece  so some linked list and stack questions for which to write the pseudo code  considering that from ece they didn expect me to know too much in depth and made sure to only based on topics knew  the first interview technical interview  so directly two rounds of interviews  finally when microsoft came for on campus recruitments they announced that all the who got in through codess would skipping the written round and group round yet attempted their first round aka the online test  we to brainstorm for project ideas during summer and implement them we didn do much though  of those who attempted the test selected  after that there an online test which consisted of three coding questions all dsa based linked lists mainly  point to noted ignore spam on class groups p  we link spammed last semester on our class groups through which registered i got in to microsoft through their program exclusively for female coders called codess  as well as they needed project proposal  personal interview consisted of technical as well as non technical hr questions  group discussion round group discussion on the given topic  one hour offline test  written test consisted of technical aptitude and verbal questions first round coding test with three questions from datastructures algorithms second round group fly writing code on paper third round technical interview mostly discussion on projects fourth round technical interview data structures algorithms operating systems fifth round hr one question from algorithms and then typical hr interview questions  basic questions on internship experience  rd round this supposed to an in depth technical round but once the interviewer me about my field of interest which web development the talk never came back to dsa round this round the hr round which pretty much straightforward hr round  then few questions about my projects and internship followed by basic dsa questions  first to prove why should selected  round second round technical round  there coding questions of lower difficulty  there mcq questions including questions from mental ability os coa dsa dds and oops  st round first round an online coding test on hackerearth  for me there rounds  suppose this the hr part of the interview round there rounds  we small informal chat  he my approach to the questions and also the ones which could not  he copy of my solutions to the questions in coding round  we thorough discussion of the projects on my resume  the interviewer real life problem and me to  round interview round technical hr  st round aptitude based test around ppl shortlisted round technical interview rd round hr interviewround coding round coding question implementation questions graph questions dynamic programming  in hr no standard hr question he just about interests  second round they about operating system questions just basic oops concepts and one coding question  then in the technical round they about my data structures project which in the resume and they me to change the structure of the project such that they can use in some company project  what problems you faced during your project work and how did you overcome ?online test two technical interviews hr interview the online test consists of coding questions  what your interests ?  what changes would you bring if you join visa ?  why may visa not hire you ?  why should visa hire you ?  in resume hr questions  discussion about the projects  analyse java code having static keyword and inheritance  array rotation problem  the inerviewer me both technical and hr questions some of which am mentioning below  there only one interview round after the coding round  two questions of implementation one question related to graph and one question related to dynamic programming  the coding round consisted of four questions  thankfully my name on the list p st round coding questions on dsa round written coding round rd round interviewthere first round of selection the coding round  then we to wait till they released the final list  he me my location preference list and then we talked about general things such as college weather  this pretty easy although they tend to you hypothetical job scenario questions  this by far the longest interview  later he me about what technology would willing to work on  again approach matters they usually you to optimize your solution  they tend to dynamic programming questions here  to the problem and code on the white board  then we moved on to coding questions  again the interviewer browsed through my cv and me questions related to the projects  rd round white board interview with the country tech head of jp morgan  fared quite well in this one  they really focused on how approached the problem  they mainly me about my projects and then went on to me few systems design questions  two panel members who quite friendly  two to three coding questions and few mcq s of logical and comp sci related questions  st round standard coding test on hackerrank we rounds for jp morgan  finally students selected and to fill out an application form and submit along with their photo  hr interview round with few java questions but mostly focussed on hr questions  also very few hr questions  technical interview round same as previous round but more focussed on java and oops concepts  questions from resume also like projects and other works  technical interview round in this round concept based technical questions on sql java and few logical puzzles  total of students shortlisted for the interviw rounds  online coding round online coding questions most of which mcqs logical aptitude and output questions and the other few writing the code the selection procedure consisted of rounds  past experiences about internships  about the company and their work  pen paper code writing of printing all permutations of string  few questions based on trees  sorting algorithms and best worst case scenarios  puzzle of measuring mins with thread  rd round technical face face  few questions based on favourite datastructure time complexity  web development so about mvc architecture how to select nodes in jquery  questions based on resume  round technical face face interview  mcqs based on aptitude operating systems oops  coding questions based algorithms and datastructures next we multiple rounds of technical interviews where they questions on probability some dice question datastructures and algorithms finding if two linked lists merge interval scheduling st round online coding round on hackerrank  around shortlisted for interviews online round sections coding quants maths and logical reasoning  make sure you in quiet place with good network connectivity  you could also to give your personal experiences as examples to back the character traits you define yourself with  you might to walk them through your resume  s almost like an hr round  s telephonic interview with one of the senior members at zs associates from their pune or gurugram office  the final round is the fit round  s important to honest while answering these questions and not to go around in circles  lot of questions will on your work  worked as the operations manager at wheels on roll so that really helped me for my role  s not necessary that you have  they go through your resume to see whether the kind of work you have has any relation to the role that you seeking  the third round the resume interview round  the pattern of the case study can different with each test but the important thing is to know the approach and attempt  but when they sit with you to discuss the case study they make you attempt again in case you haven  could only reach till section  the important thing is to go through the entire case study at least once  so you ll need some out of the box for this  the third section is about marketing  something like odd thing out  there will long list of numbers as sometimes they ll put an alphabet in the middle  so you need to keenly look at what s wrong with the data given in this section  the second part is error identification and data representation  but s also important that you leave blank  wasted minutes of my thirty minutes on this  spend all the time on this though  numbers not easy to work on but if you know the approach then guess works  the first part is calculation intensive  the case study is distributed into three parts  s almost impossible for you to finish all the questions so there is no need for you to freak out when you look at the questions  the second round is case study round for which you get minutes  make sure you have good quality webcam built into your laptop  the test platform does all the checks for video and audio to make sure your headphone and mic work  then you given minute to collect your thoughts and another minutes to answer the question  bot asks you questions regarding your personal experiences learnings and guesstimate questions  at the end of this online test if you cleared the aptitude round then you directed to video call round round online test cs mcqs aptitude questions round group discussion round technical interview round hr interviewthe first round an online test which checked your basic aptitude and logical reasoning  interview only round questions based on projects second year summer internship basic digital and microprocessors  people called for interviews  if they liked they more questions on our background projectsfirst round is test of logical reasoning data interpretation english and statistics with statistics higher weightage second round is interview both technical and hr togetherresume based shortlisting with  the second round interview we given problem statement and to come up with solution  after first round out of odd people applied who wrote people shortlisted  the other questions coding based or aptitude logical reasoning type  first standard test at the end of which subjective question which high weightage there two rounds to the process  if performed well in the round then hr interview simply for telling you that you have been selected  rd round an hr interview  os operating systems dsa data structure and algorithms  round face to face interview  coding questions more weightage than mcqs  the coding test comprised of two coding questions to solved and mcq questions on dsa data structures and algorithm  round hr interview st round an online coding test round online round debugging aptitude and programming problems round technical interview questions on data structures algorithms and projects in resume  interview concluded with quick question on arrays which the easiest  this followed by couple of behavioural questions and why gpa not up to the mark  to explain applications of digital signal processing and transforms  then about linked lists which fairly straightforward  first question on file handling which couldnt answer  couple of logical puzzles also  as the project in python some questions on pandas dataframes  interview about my year internship  the second one to output the first non repeating character in string with only o n loop  the first one how many rectangles could formed in matrix such that each rectangle has as its border elements  given coding questions for which to come up with logic and pseudocode there rounds written test and interview written test an individual pen paper round of about min  people offered the internship he then me if some questions for him which he answered i shown some inclination towards physics he me some questions on the interviewer questions about my previous internship he then went through my resume  people selected for the next round second round hr interview the interviewer first me to introduce myself  there one programing question with marks for each test cases most of them dsa questions and some logical reasoning and aptitude  this round consisted of around mcq questions  first round online round conducted in hackerearth the test for hr there rounds in the selection process  tip show interest in the company and questions about the work whenever possible  round third interview discussion on my past projects possible improvements in them and some hr questions  tip sure about the things you mention in your resume  round second interview where questions based on my resume and some design questions based on oop and os concepts  if have worked with linux tip confident and discuss your approach with the interviewer even if you think its very brute solution  good variable names short comments round first interview where questions on my past work experience and the work difficulties faced and some basic algorithmic questions based on linux commands  tip discuss your approach and write proper readable code  round group fly round where shortlisted candidates divided in groups and to code on paper and few selected in each group for interviews  get familiar with the platform beforehand if possible  tip have clear understanding of the basic data structures like ll and their implementation in c in of basic algorithmic questions round online contest on http cocubes  round based questions on my resume and project in for dsa questions you to explain logic as well as write code on paper  technical rounds with majorly dsa questions and math questions  they interview for different divisions so each interview can for new division or next round of interview for particular division  for me there interviews  cs related coding question mcq questions b math aptitude questions  next rounds of interviews first technical and then hrround online test on hackerrank consists of two sections first round online test with parts aptitude hardware and coding  around people shortlisted for interviews and made to the final round from which selected for the internship  they stress heavily on java skills and oop fundamentals as well as os and the basics of data structures stacks queues linked lists  during the technical interviews they us about our projects listed on our resumes and also questions related to courses we taken our interests  you could code in pretty much any language so no language restriction as such after that we called in for rounds of technical interview and hr interview  the coding questions involved data structures and dyanmic programming the latter being very fundamental to solving the question at hand  time from each section rolls over into the next if you finish section before time and so suggest not spending too much time on aptitude if you aren getting answers and using that time to crack the coding questions  you end up with about minute per question  aptitide questions of the general type but challenging to complete in the very short time frame given to them the selection procedure starts with an online test of aptitude questions and coding questions  one of them based on graphs and involved all the graph concepts and involved lot of  the third round also lasted for an hour where two questions  the questions of medium hard level  the second round an exhaustive hour interview where just dsa questions mostly graph and trees and told to write the code for all of them on paper  so forget to submit as soon as you finish the test  however the ties broken based on time  all the aptitude and coding questions pretty basic  this round pretty simple  the first round coding aptitude  hr interviewthere three rounds  online round debugging apti coding  they covered lot of basic concepts from most courses not just software  the technical rounds in increasing order of difficulty there three technical rounds for me and then hr round  round hr just formality  rd round interview on the same topics as second round  st round online test with mcqs round interview fundamental rc rl diode and transistor based circuit analysis  there not many questions in hr as they flight to catch  some people the reason for their low cgpa  they also checking the cgpa  interviewer good and friendly  totally about electrical machines and switch gear and also some general knowledge about electrical engineering in daily use  he from my areas of interest which machines and pulled to switch gear  round there an technical interview for those who got shortlisted in the online test a little knowledge about the company would also helpful round there an online test which totally logical reasoning english comprehension and analytical reasoning  they me about my projects and questions related to my resume  third round hr round they basically test your approach in every question so make sure you answer something the interview went for like an hour  good knowledge in os and oops would also help  since from electrical they me questions only related to dsa  second round tech interview the test on amcat platform  the cut off and all branches eligible to write the test first round online test which included quantitative aptitute logical reasoning verbal reasoning and two coding questions  the last round the hr interview where everything about your life interests and activities put up on the resume questioned  questions related to project area of interest and little brain storming with few problem statements  the second round technical interview round students shortlisted based of their projects work experience the first round resume shortlisting  there total interviews tehnical and hr  the selected students called for interview rounds there coding aptitute test held in ccc as the first round  so is good to attend the ppt s  the interviewer later
